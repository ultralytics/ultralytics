# BoT-SORT tracker defaults for mode="track"
# Docs: https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/track/

tracker_type: botsort # (str) Tracker backend: botsort|bytetrack; choose botsort to enable BoT-SORT features
track_high_thresh: 0.25 # (float) First-stage match threshold; raise for cleaner tracks, lower to keep more
track_low_thresh: 0.1 # (float) Second-stage threshold for low-score matches; balances recovery vs drift
new_track_thresh: 0.25 # (float) Start a new track if no match â‰¥ this; higher reduces false tracks
track_buffer: 30 # (int) Frames to keep lost tracks alive; higher handles occlusion, increases ID switches risk
match_thresh: 0.8 # (float) Association similarity threshold (IoU/cost); tune with detector quality
fuse_score: True # (bool) Fuse detection score with motion/IoU for matching; stabilizes weak detections

# BoT-SORT specifics
gmc_method: sparseOptFlow # (str) Global motion compensation: sparseOptFlow|orb|none; helps moving camera scenes

# ReID model related thresh
proximity_thresh: 0.5 # (float) Min IoU to consider tracks proximate for ReID; higher is stricter
appearance_thresh: 0.8 # (float) Min appearance similarity for ReID; raise to avoid identity swaps
with_reid: False # (bool) Enable ReID model use; needs extra model and compute
model: auto # (str) ReID model name/path; "auto" uses detector features if available

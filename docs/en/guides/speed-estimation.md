# Speed Estimation using Ultralytics YOLO11 ðŸš€

## What is Speed Estimation?

[Speed estimation](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/ultralytics-yolov8-for-speed-estimation-in-computer-vision-projects) is the process of calculating the rate of movement of an object within a given context, often employed in [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) applications. Using [Ultralytics YOLO11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/) you can now calculate the speed of object using [object tracking](../modes/track.md) alongside distance and time data, crucial for tasks like traffic and surveillance. The accuracy of speed estimation directly influences the efficiency and reliability of various applications, making it a key component in the advancement of intelligent systems and real-time decision-making processes.

## FAQ

### How do I estimate object speed using Ultralytics YOLO11?

Estimating object speed with Ultralytics YOLO11 involves combining [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) and tracking techniques. First, you need to detect objects in each frame using the YOLO11 model. Then, track these objects across frames to calculate their movement over time. Finally, use the distance traveled by the object between frames and the frame rate to estimate its speed.

**Example**:

```python
import cv2

from ultralytics import solutions

cap = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/video/file.mp4")
w, h, fps = (int(cap.get(x)) for x in (cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))
video_writer = cv2.VideoWriter("speed_estimation.avi", cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"mp4v"), fps, (w, h))

# Initialize SpeedEstimator
speedestimator = solutions.SpeedEstimator(
    region=[(0, 360), (1280, 360)],
    model="yolo11n.pt",
    show=True,
)

while cap.isOpened():
    success, im0 = cap.read()
    if not success:
        break
    results = speedestimator(im0)
    video_writer.write(results.plot_im)

cap.release()
video_writer.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### How accurate is the speed estimation using Ultralytics YOLO11?

The [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy) of speed estimation using Ultralytics YOLO11 depends on several factors, including the quality of the object tracking, the resolution and frame rate of the video, and environmental variables. While the speed estimator provides reliable estimates, it may not be 100% accurate due to variances in frame processing speed and object occlusion.

**Note**: Always consider margin of error and validate the estimates with ground truth data when possible.

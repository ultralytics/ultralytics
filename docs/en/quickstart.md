    <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: -20px;">![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/ultralytics?logo=python&logoColor=gold)<p>

    === "Pip install (recommended)"

        Install the `ultralytics` package using pip, or update an existing installation by running `pip install -U ultralytics`. Visit the Python Package Index (PyPI) for more details on the `ultralytics` package: [https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/](https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/).

        [![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ultralytics?logo=pypi&logoColor=white)](https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/)
        [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/ultralytics)](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/ultralytics)

        ```bash
        # Install the ultralytics package from PyPI
        pip install ultralytics
        ```

        You can also install the `ultralytics` package directly from the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). This might be useful if you want the latest development version. Make sure to have the Git command-line tool installed on your system. The `@main` command installs the `main` branch and may be modified to another branch, i.e. `@my-branch`, or removed entirely to default to `main` branch.

        ```bash
        # Install the ultralytics package from GitHub
        pip install git+https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics.git@main
        ```

    === "Conda install"

        Conda is an alternative package manager to pip which may also be used for installation. Visit Anaconda for more details at [https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ultralytics](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ultralytics). Ultralytics feedstock repository for updating the conda package is at [https://github.com/conda-forge/ultralytics-feedstock/](https://github.com/conda-forge/ultralytics-feedstock/).

        [![Conda Version](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/ultralytics?logo=condaforge)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ultralytics)
        [![Conda Downloads](https://img.shields.io/conda/dn/conda-forge/ultralytics.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ultralytics)
        [![Conda Recipe](https://img.shields.io/badge/recipe-ultralytics-green.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ultralytics)
        [![Conda Platforms](https://img.shields.io/conda/pn/conda-forge/ultralytics.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ultralytics)

        ```bash
        # Install the ultralytics package using conda
        conda install -c conda-forge ultralytics
        ```

        !!! note

            If you are installing in a CUDA environment best practice is to install `ultralytics`, `pytorch` and `pytorch-cuda` in the same command to allow the conda package manager to resolve any conflicts, or else to install `pytorch-cuda` last to allow it override the CPU-specific `pytorch` package if necessary.
            ```bash
            # Install all packages together using conda
            conda install -c pytorch -c nvidia -c conda-forge pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.8 ultralytics
            ```

        ### Conda Docker Image

        Ultralytics Conda Docker images are also available from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/ultralytics). These images are based on [Miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) and are an simple way to start using `ultralytics` in a Conda environment.

        ```bash
        # Set image name as a variable
        t=ultralytics/ultralytics:latest-conda

        # Pull the latest ultralytics image from Docker Hub
        sudo docker pull $t

        # Run the ultralytics image in a container with GPU support
        sudo docker run -it --ipc=host --gpus all $t  # all GPUs
        sudo docker run -it --ipc=host --gpus '"device=2,3"' $t  # specify GPUs
        ```

    === "Git clone"

        Clone the `ultralytics` repository if you are interested in contributing to the development or wish to experiment with the latest source code. After cloning, navigate into the directory and install the package in editable mode `-e` using pip.

        [![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/ultralytics/ultralytics?logo=github)](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
        [![GitHub commit activity](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/t/ultralytics/ultralytics)](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)

        ```bash
        # Clone the ultralytics repository
        git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics

        # Navigate to the cloned directory
        cd ultralytics

        # Install the package in editable mode for development
        pip install -e .
        ```

    === "Docker"

        Utilize Docker to effortlessly execute the `ultralytics` package in an isolated container, ensuring consistent and smooth performance across various environments. By choosing one of the official `ultralytics` images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/ultralytics), you not only avoid the complexity of local installation but also benefit from access to a verified working environment. Ultralytics offers 5 main supported Docker images, each designed to provide high compatibility and efficiency for different platforms and use cases:

        [![Docker Image Version](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/ultralytics/ultralytics?sort=semver&logo=docker)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/ultralytics)
        [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/ultralytics/ultralytics)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/ultralytics)

        - **Dockerfile:** GPU image recommended for training.
        - **Dockerfile-arm64:** Optimized for ARM64 architecture, allowing deployment on devices like Raspberry Pi and other ARM64-based platforms.
        - **Dockerfile-cpu:** Ubuntu-based CPU-only version suitable for inference and environments without GPUs.
        - **Dockerfile-jetson:** Tailored for NVIDIA Jetson devices, integrating GPU support optimized for these platforms.
        - **Dockerfile-python:** Minimal image with just Python and necessary dependencies, ideal for lightweight applications and development.
        - **Dockerfile-conda:** Based on Miniconda3 with conda installation of ultralytics package.

        Below are the commands to get the latest image and execute it:

        ```bash
        # Set image name as a variable
        t=ultralytics/ultralytics:latest

        # Pull the latest ultralytics image from Docker Hub
        sudo docker pull $t

        # Run the ultralytics image in a container with GPU support
        sudo docker run -it --ipc=host --gpus all $t  # all GPUs
        sudo docker run -it --ipc=host --gpus '"device=2,3"' $t  # specify GPUs
        ```

        The above command initializes a Docker container with the latest `ultralytics` image. The `-it` flag assigns a pseudo-TTY and maintains stdin open, enabling you to interact with the container. The `--ipc=host` flag sets the IPC (Inter-Process Communication) namespace to the host, which is essential for sharing memory between processes. The `--gpus all` flag enables access to all available GPUs inside the container, which is crucial for tasks that require GPU computation.

        Note: To work with files on your local machine within the container, use Docker volumes for mounting a local directory into the container:

        ```bash
        # Mount local directory to a directory inside the container
        sudo docker run -it --ipc=host --gpus all -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container $t
        ```

        Alter `/path/on/host` with the directory path on your local machine, and `/path/in/container` with the desired path inside the Docker container for accessibility.

        For advanced Docker usage, feel free to explore the [Ultralytics Docker Guide](./guides/docker-quickstart.md).

See the `ultralytics` [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/pyproject.toml) file for a list of dependencies. Note that all examples above install all required dependencies.

!!! tip

## Use Ultralytics with Python

YOLO's Python interface allows for seamless integration into your Python projects, making it easy to load, run, and process the model's output. Designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, the Python interface enables users to quickly implement [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection), segmentation, and classification in their projects. This makes YOLO's Python interface an invaluable tool for anyone looking to incorporate these functionalities into their Python projects.

For example, users can load a model, train it, evaluate its performance on a validation set, and even export it to ONNX format with just a few lines of code. Check out the [Python Guide](usage/python.md) to learn more about using YOLO within your Python projects.

!!! example

    ```python
    from ultralytics import YOLO

    # Create a new YOLO model from scratch
    model = YOLO("yolo11n.yaml")

    # Load a pretrained YOLO model (recommended for training)
    model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

    # Train the model using the 'coco8.yaml' dataset for 3 epochs
    results = model.train(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=3)

    # Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set
    results = model.val()

    # Perform object detection on an image using the model
    results = model("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")

    # Export the model to ONNX format
    success = model.export(format="onnx")
    ```

## Ultralytics Settings

The Ultralytics library provides a powerful settings management system to enable fine-grained control over your experiments. By making use of the `SettingsManager` housed within the `ultralytics.utils` module, users can readily access and alter their settings. These are stored in a JSON file in the environment user configuration directory, and can be viewed or modified directly within the Python environment or via the Command-Line Interface (CLI).

### Inspecting Settings

To gain insight into the current configuration of your settings, you can view them directly:

!!! example "View settings"

    === "Python"

        You can use Python to view your settings. Start by importing the `settings` object from the `ultralytics` module. Print and return settings using the following commands:
        ```python
        from ultralytics import settings

        # View all settings
        print(settings)

        # Return a specific setting
        value = settings["runs_dir"]
        ```

    === "CLI"

        Alternatively, the command-line interface allows you to check your settings with a simple command:
        ```bash
        yolo settings
        ```

### Modifying Settings

Ultralytics allows users to easily modify their settings. Changes can be performed in the following ways:

!!! example "Update settings"

    === "Python"

        Within the Python environment, call the `update` method on the `settings` object to change your settings:
        ```python
        from ultralytics import settings

        # Update a setting
        settings.update({"runs_dir": "/path/to/runs"})

        # Update multiple settings
        settings.update({"runs_dir": "/path/to/runs", "tensorboard": False})

        # Reset settings to default values
        settings.reset()
        ```

    === "CLI"

        If you prefer using the command-line interface, the following commands will allow you to modify your settings:
        ```bash
        # Update a setting
        yolo settings runs_dir='/path/to/runs'

        # Update multiple settings
        yolo settings runs_dir='/path/to/runs' tensorboard=False

        # Reset settings to default values
        yolo settings reset
        ```

### Understanding Settings

## FAQ

### How do I install Ultralytics using pip?

To install Ultralytics with pip, execute the following command:

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

For the latest stable release, this will install the `ultralytics` package directly from the Python Package Index (PyPI). For more details, visit the [ultralytics package on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/).

Alternatively, you can install the latest development version directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics.git
```

Make sure to have the Git command-line tool installed on your system.

### Can I install Ultralytics YOLO using conda?

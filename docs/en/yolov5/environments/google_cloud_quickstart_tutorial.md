# Mastering YOLOv5 Deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Deep Learning VM

Embarking on the journey of [artificial intelligence](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/artificial-intelligence-ai) and machine learning can be exhilarating, especially when you leverage the power and flexibility of a cloud platform. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers robust tools tailored for machine learning enthusiasts and professionals alike. One such tool is the Deep Learning VM that is preconfigured for data science and ML tasks. In this tutorial, we will navigate through the process of setting up [YOLOv5](../index.md) on a GCP Deep Learning VM. Whether you're taking your first steps in ML or you're a seasoned practitioner, this guide is designed to provide you with a clear pathway to implementing object detection models powered by YOLOv5.

ðŸ†“ Plus, if you're a fresh GCP user, you're in luck with a [$300 free credit offer](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#free-trial) to kickstart your projects.

In addition to GCP, explore other accessible quickstart options for YOLOv5, like our [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb) <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"> for a browser-based experience, or the scalability of [Amazon AWS](./aws_quickstart_tutorial.md). Furthermore, container aficionados can utilize our official Docker image at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/yolov5) <img src="https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/ultralytics/yolov5?logo=docker" alt="Docker Pulls"> for an encapsulated environment.

## Step 1: Create and Configure Your Deep Learning VM

Let's begin by creating a virtual machine that's tuned for [deep learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/deep-learning-dl):

1. Head over to the [GCP marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/click-to-deploy-images/deeplearning) and select the **Deep Learning VM**.
2. Opt for a **n1-standard-8** instance; it offers a balance of 8 vCPUs and 30 GB of memory, ideally suited for our needs.
3. Next, select a GPU. This depends on your workload; even a basic one like the T4 will markedly accelerate your model training.
4. Tick the box for 'Install NVIDIA GPU driver automatically on first startup?' for hassle-free setup.
5. Allocate a 300 GB SSD Persistent Disk to ensure you don't bottleneck on I/O operations.
6. Hit 'Deploy' and let GCP do its magic in provisioning your custom Deep Learning VM.

This VM comes loaded with a treasure trove of preinstalled tools and frameworks, including the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python distribution, which conveniently bundles all the necessary dependencies for YOLOv5.

## Step 2: Ready the VM for YOLOv5

Following the environment setup, let's get YOLOv5 up and running:

```bash
# Clone the YOLOv5 repository
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5

# Change the directory to the cloned repository
cd yolov5

# Install the necessary Python packages from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This setup process ensures you're working with a Python environment version 3.8.0 or newer and [PyTorch](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/pytorch) 1.8 or above. Our scripts smoothly download [models](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/models) and [datasets](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/data) directly from the latest YOLOv5 [release](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases), making it hassle-free to start model training.

## Step 3: Train and Deploy Your YOLOv5 Models

With the setup complete, you're ready to delve into training and inference with YOLOv5 on your GCP VM:

```bash
# Train a model on your data
python train.py

# Validate the trained model for Precision, Recall, and mAP
python val.py --weights yolov5s.pt

# Run inference using the trained model on your images or videos
python detect.py --weights yolov5s.pt --source path/to/images

# Export the trained model to other formats for deployment
python export.py --weights yolov5s.pt --include onnx coreml tflite
```

With just a few commands, YOLOv5 allows you to train custom [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) models tailored to your specific needs or utilize pre-trained weights for quick results on a variety of tasks.

## Allocate Swap Space (Optional)

For those dealing with hefty datasets, consider amplifying your GCP instance with an additional 64GB of swap memory:

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 64G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
free -h  # confirm the memory increment
```

## Training Custom Datasets

To train YOLOv5 on your custom dataset in GCP, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset in YOLOv5 format (images and labels)
2. Upload your dataset to your GCP VM using `gcloud` or SCP
3. Create a dataset YAML file specifying paths and classes
4. Start training with the appropriate parameters:

```bash
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 100 --data custom.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt
```

For more detailed instructions on training with custom datasets, refer to the [Ultralytics YOLOv5 documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/yolov5/).

## Leveraging Cloud Storage

For efficient data management, integrate your YOLOv5 workflow with Google Cloud Storage:

```bash
# Install Google Cloud SDK if not already installed
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
gcloud init

# Copy data to/from Cloud Storage
gsutil cp -r gs://your-bucket/dataset ./
gsutil cp -r ./runs/train/exp/weights gs://your-bucket/models/
```

This approach allows you to store large datasets and trained models securely in the cloud while keeping your VM storage requirements minimal.

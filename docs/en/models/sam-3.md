**SAM 3** (Segment Anything Model 3) represents Meta's next-generation foundation model for **Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS)**. Building upon [SAM 2](sam-2.md), SAM 3 introduces a fundamentally new capability: detecting, segmenting, and tracking **all instances** of a visual concept specified by text prompts, image exemplars, or both. Unlike previous SAM versions that segment single objects per prompt, SAM 3 can find and segment every occurrence of a concept appearing anywhere in images or videos.

## Overview

SAM 3 achieves a **2√ó performance gain** over existing systems in Promptable Concept Segmentation while maintaining and improving SAM 2's capabilities for interactive visual segmentation. The model excels at open-vocabulary segmentation, allowing users to specify concepts using simple noun phrases (e.g., "yellow school bus", "striped cat") or by providing example images of the target object.

### What is Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS)?

The PCS task takes a **concept prompt** as input and returns segmentation masks with unique identities for **all matching object instances**. Concept prompts can be:

- **Text**: Simple noun phrases like "red apple" or "person wearing a hat"
- **Image exemplars**: Bounding boxes around example objects (positive or negative)
- **Combined**: Both text and image exemplars together for precise control

This differs from traditional visual prompts (points, boxes, masks) which segment only a single specific object instance.

### Key Performance Metrics

| Metric                           | SAM 3 Achievement                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LVIS Zero-Shot Mask AP**       | **47.0** (vs previous best 38.5, +22% improvement)          |
| **SA-Co Benchmark**              | **2√ó better** than existing systems                         |
| **Inference Speed (H200 GPU)**   | **30 ms** per image with 100+ detected objects              |
| **Video Performance**            | Near real-time for ~5 concurrent objects                    |
| **MOSEv2 VOS Benchmark**         | **60.1 J&F** (+25.5% over SAM 2.1, +17% over prior SOTA)   |
| **Interactive Refinement**       | **+18.6 CGF1** improvement after 3 exemplar prompts         |
| **Human Performance Gap**        | Achieves **88%** of estimated lower bound on SA-Co/Gold     |

## Architecture

SAM 3 consists of a **detector** and **tracker** that share a Perception Encoder (PE) vision backbone. This decoupled design avoids task conflicts while enabling both image-level detection and video-level tracking.

### Core Components

- **Detector**: DETR-based architecture for image-level concept detection
  - Text encoder for noun phrase prompts
  - Exemplar encoder for image-based prompts
  - Fusion encoder to condition image features on prompts
  - Novel **presence head** that decouples recognition ("what") from localization ("where")
  - Mask head for generating instance segmentation masks

- **Tracker**: Memory-based video segmentation inherited from SAM 2
  - Prompt encoder, mask decoder, memory encoder
  - Memory bank for storing object appearance across frames
  - Temporal disambiguation strategies for crowded scenes

- **Presence Token**: A learned global token that predicts whether the target concept is present in the image/frame, significantly boosting detection accuracy by separating recognition from localization tasks.

![SAM 3 Architecture](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/sam3-architecture-diagram.avif)

### Key Innovations

1. **Decoupled Recognition and Localization**: The presence head predicts concept presence globally, while proposal queries focus only on localization, avoiding conflicting objectives.

2. **Unified Concept and Visual Prompts**: Supports both PCS (concept prompts) and PVS (visual prompts like SAM 2's clicks/boxes) in a single model.

3. **Interactive Exemplar Refinement**: Users can add positive or negative image exemplars to iteratively refine results, with the model generalizing to similar objects rather than just correcting individual instances.

4. **Temporal Disambiguation**: Uses masklet detection scores and periodic re-prompting to handle occlusions, crowded scenes, and tracking failures in video.

## SA-Co Dataset

SAM 3 is trained on **Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co)**, Meta's largest and most diverse segmentation dataset to date.

### Benchmark Data

The **SA-Co evaluation benchmark** contains **214K unique phrases** across **126K images and videos**, providing over **50√ó more concepts** than existing benchmarks. It includes:

- **SA-Co/Gold**: 7 domains, triple-annotated for measuring human performance bounds
- **SA-Co/Silver**: 10 domains, single human annotation
- **SA-Co/Bronze** and **SA-Co/Bio**: 9 existing datasets adapted for concept segmentation
- **SA-Co/VEval**: Video benchmark with 3 domains (SA-V, YT-Temporal-1B, SmartGlasses)

### Data Engine Innovations

SAM 3's scalable human- and model-in-the-loop data engine achieves **2√ó annotation throughput** through:

1. **AI Annotators**: Llama-based models propose diverse noun phrases including hard negatives
2. **AI Verifiers**: Fine-tuned MLLMs verify mask quality and exhaustivity at near-human performance
3. **Active Mining**: Focuses human effort on challenging failure cases where AI struggles
4. **Ontology-Driven**: Leverages 22.4M node SA-Co ontology based on Wikidata for concept coverage

| **YTVOS19**       | J&F    | **89.6** | 89.3      | +0.3%       |

### Few-Shot Adaptation

SAM 3 excels at adapting to new domains with minimal examples:

| Benchmark          | 0-shot AP | 10-shot AP | Previous Best (10-shot) |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| **ODinW13**        | 59.9      | **71.6**   | 67.9 (gDino1.5-Pro)     |
| **Roboflow100-VL** | 14.3      | **35.7**   | 33.7 (gDino-T)          |

### Interactive Refinement Effectiveness

SAM 3's concept-based prompting with exemplars converges much faster than visual prompting:

| Prompts Added | CGF1 Score | Gain vs Text-Only | Gain vs PVS Baseline |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Text only     | 46.4       | baseline          | baseline             |
| +1 exemplar   | 57.6       | +11.2             | +6.7                 |
| +2 exemplars  | 62.2       | +15.8             | +9.7                 |
| +3 exemplars  | **65.0**   | **+18.6**         | **+11.2**            |
| +4 exemplars  | 65.7       | +19.3             | +11.5 (plateau)      |

Exemplar-based PCS converges faster than click-based PVS by generalizing to similar objects.

### Object Counting Accuracy

SAM 3 provides accurate counting by segmenting all instances:

| Benchmark        | Accuracy | MAE  | vs Best MLLM       |
| ---------------- | -------- | ---- | ------------------ |
| **CountBench**   | **95.6%** | 0.11 | 92.4% (Gemini 2.5) |

**Key Takeaways**:

- **SAM 3**: Best for open-vocabulary concept segmentation, finding all instances of a concept with text or exemplar prompts
- **SAM 2**: Best for interactive single-object segmentation in images and videos with geometric prompts
- **YOLO11**: Best for real-time, high-speed segmentation in resource-constrained environments with known categories

## Evaluation Metrics

SAM 3 introduces new metrics designed for the PCS task:

### Classification-Gated F1 (CGF1)

The primary metric combining localization and classification:

**CGF1 = 100 √ó pmF1 √ó IL_MCC**

Where:
- **pmF1** (Positive Macro F1): Measures localization quality on positive examples
- **IL_MCC** (Image-Level Matthews Correlation Coefficient): Measures binary classification accuracy ("is the concept present?")

### Why These Metrics?

Traditional AP metrics don't account for calibration, making models difficult to use in practice. By evaluating only predictions above 0.5 confidence, SAM 3's metrics enforce good calibration and mimic real-world usage patterns.

## Key Ablations and Insights

### Impact of Presence Head

The presence head decouples recognition from localization, providing significant improvements:

| Configuration     | CGF1  | IL_MCC | pmF1  |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| Without presence  | 57.6  | 0.77   | 74.7  |
| **With presence** | **63.3** | **0.82** | **77.1** |

The presence head provides a **+5.7 CGF1 boost** (+9.9%), primarily improving recognition ability (IL_MCC +6.5%).

### Effect of Hard Negatives

| Hard Negatives/Image | CGF1  | IL_MCC | pmF1  |
| -------------------- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| 0                    | 31.8  | 0.44   | 70.2  |
| 5                    | 44.8  | 0.62   | 71.9  |
| **30**               | **49.2** | **0.68** | **72.3** |

Hard negatives are crucial for open-vocabulary recognition, improving IL_MCC by **54.5%** (0.44 ‚Üí 0.68).

### Training Data Scaling

| Data Sources         | CGF1  | IL_MCC | pmF1  |
| -------------------- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| External only        | 30.9  | 0.46   | 66.3  |
| External + Synthetic | 39.7  | 0.57   | 70.6  |
| External + HQ        | 51.8  | 0.71   | 73.2  |
| **All three**        | **54.3** | **0.74** | **73.5** |

High-quality human annotations (SA-Co/HQ) provide **+14.6 CGF1** over synthetic data, and **+23.4 CGF1** over external data alone.

## Applications

SAM 3's concept segmentation capability enables new use cases:

- **Content Moderation**: Find all instances of specific content types across large media libraries
- **E-commerce**: Segment all products of a certain type in catalog images
- **Medical Imaging**: Identify all occurrences of specific tissue types or abnormalities
- **Autonomous Systems**: Track all instances of traffic signs, pedestrians, or vehicles by category
- **Video Analytics**: Count and track all people wearing specific clothing or performing actions
- **Dataset Annotation**: Rapidly annotate all instances of rare object categories
- **Scientific Research**: Quantify and analyze all specimens matching specific criteria

## SAM 3 Agent: Extended Language Reasoning

SAM 3 can be combined with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to handle complex queries requiring reasoning:

### Example Complex Queries

SAM 3 Agent can handle queries requiring reasoning:

- "People sitting down but not holding a gift box in their hands"
- "The dog closest to the camera that is not wearing a collar"
- "Red objects larger than the person's hand"

The MLLM proposes simple noun phrase queries to SAM 3, analyzes returned masks, and iterates until satisfied.

## Limitations

While SAM 3 represents a major advancement, it has certain limitations:

- **Phrase Complexity**: Best suited for simple noun phrases; long referring expressions or complex reasoning may require MLLM integration
- **Ambiguity Handling**: Some concepts remain inherently ambiguous (e.g., "small window", "cozy room")
- **Computational Requirements**: Larger and slower than specialized detection models like YOLO
- **Vocabulary Scope**: Focused on atomic visual concepts; compositional reasoning is limited without MLLM assistance
- **Rare Concepts**: Performance degrades on extremely rare or fine-grained concepts not well-represented in training data

## FAQ

### When will SAM 3 be released?

SAM 3 is currently under review at ICLR 2026 (conference in 2026, review in 2025). Official models, weights, and benchmarks will be released publicly following the review process, likely in **2025-2026**. Ultralytics will provide immediate support for SAM 3 integration upon Meta's release.

### Will SAM 3 be integrated into Ultralytics?

Yes. SAM 3 will be fully supported in the Ultralytics Python package upon release, including:

- **Concept Segmentation**: Text and image exemplar prompts for finding all matching instances
- **Visual Segmentation**: Full SAM 2 compatibility for single-object segmentation
- **Video Tracking**: Multi-object tracking with concept-based initialization
- **Interactive Refinement**: Both exemplar-based and click-based refinement
- **Auto-Annotation**: Dataset creation with concept-based prompting
- **Export**: Model conversion to ONNX, TensorRT, and other formats

!!! warning "Implementation Timeline"
    
    Code examples in this documentation are preview versions showing intended usage patterns. Actual implementation will be available after Meta releases SAM 3 weights and Ultralytics completes integration.

### What is Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS)?

PCS is a new task introduced in SAM 3 that segments **all instances** of a visual concept in an image or video. Unlike traditional segmentation that targets a specific object instance, PCS finds every occurrence of a category. For example:

- **Text prompt**: "yellow school bus" ‚Üí segments all yellow school buses in the scene
- **Image exemplar**: Box around one dog ‚Üí segments all dogs in the image
- **Combined**: "striped cat" + exemplar box ‚Üí segments all striped cats matching the example

This differs from SAM 2's visual segmentation which segments only the single object you click on or box.

### How does SAM 3 differ from SAM 2?

SAM 3 expands on SAM 2 with several major capabilities:

| Feature                     | SAM 2                              | SAM 3                                        |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Task**                    | Single object per prompt           | All instances of a concept                   |
| **Prompt Types**            | Points, boxes, masks               | + Text phrases, image exemplars              |
| **Detection Capability**    | Requires external detector         | Built-in open-vocabulary detector            |
| **Recognition**             | Geometry-based only                | Text and visual recognition                  |
| **Architecture**            | Tracker only                       | Detector + Tracker with presence head        |
| **Zero-Shot Performance**   | N/A (requires visual prompts)      | 47.0 AP on LVIS, 2√ó better on SA-Co          |
| **Interactive Refinement**  | Clicks only                        | Clicks + exemplar generalization             |

SAM 3 maintains full backward compatibility with SAM 2's visual prompting while adding concept-based capabilities. On video segmentation, SAM 3 achieves **60.1 J&F** on MOSEv2 compared to SAM 2.1's **47.9 J&F** (+25.5% improvement).

### How can I use SAM 3 for video segmentation?

Once released, SAM 3 provides enhanced video capabilities (preview syntax):

```python
from ultralytics.models.sam import SAM3VideoPredictor

# Create predictor
predictor = SAM3VideoPredictor(model="sam3.pt")

# Track all instances of a concept across video
results = predictor(source="video.mp4", prompt="person wearing red jacket")

# Or use exemplar from first frame
results = predictor(source="video.mp4", bboxes=[100, 150, 300, 400], labels=[1])
```

!!! warning "API Preview"
    
    This code demonstrates intended usage patterns. Actual syntax may differ when SAM 3 is officially released and integrated into Ultralytics.

SAM 3 achieves **60.1 J&F** on MOSEv2 (+12.2 points over SAM 2.1) and runs at near real-time speeds for ~5 concurrent objects on H200 GPU (30 ms per frame with 100+ detections).

### What datasets are used to train SAM 3?

SAM 3 is trained on the **Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co)** dataset:

**Training Data**:
- **5.2M images** with **4M unique noun phrases** (SA-Co/HQ) - high-quality human annotations
- **52.5K videos** with **24.8K unique noun phrases** (SA-Co/VIDEO)
- **1.4B synthetic masks** across **38M noun phrases** (SA-Co/SYN)
- **15 external datasets** enriched with hard negatives (SA-Co/EXT)

**Benchmark Data**:
- **214K unique concepts** across **126K images/videos**
- **50√ó more concepts** than existing benchmarks (e.g., LVIS has ~4K concepts)
- Triple annotation on SA-Co/Gold for measuring human performance bounds

This massive scale and diversity enables SAM 3's superior zero-shot generalization across open-vocabulary concepts.

### How does SAM 3 compare to YOLO11 for segmentation?

SAM 3 and YOLO11 serve different use cases:

**SAM 3 Advantages**:
- **Open-vocabulary**: Segments any concept via text prompts without training
- **Zero-shot**: Works on new categories immediately
- **Interactive**: Exemplar-based refinement generalizes to similar objects
- **Concept-based**: Automatically finds all instances of a category
- **Accuracy**: 47.0 AP on LVIS zero-shot instance segmentation

**YOLO11 Advantages**:
- **Speed**: 10-15√ó faster inference (2-3ms vs 30ms per image)
- **Efficiency**: 70√ó smaller models (5.9MB vs ~400MB expected)
- **Resource-friendly**: Runs on edge devices and mobile
- **Real-time**: Optimized for production deployments

**Recommendation**: 
- Use **SAM 3** for flexible, open-vocabulary segmentation where you need to find all instances of concepts described by text or examples
- Use **YOLO11** for high-speed, production deployments where categories are known in advance
- Use **SAM 2** for interactive single-object segmentation with geometric prompts

### Can SAM 3 handle complex language queries?

SAM 3 is designed for simple noun phrases (e.g., "red apple", "person wearing hat"). For complex queries requiring reasoning, combine SAM 3 with an MLLM as **SAM 3 Agent**:

**Simple queries (native SAM 3)**:
- "yellow school bus"
- "striped cat"
- "person wearing red hat"

**Complex queries (SAM 3 Agent with MLLM)**:
- "People sitting down but not holding a gift box"
- "The dog closest to the camera without a collar"
- "Red objects larger than the person's hand"

SAM 3 Agent achieves **76.0 gIoU** on ReasonSeg validation (vs 65.0 previous best, +16.9% improvement) by combining SAM 3's segmentation with MLLM reasoning capabilities.

### How accurate is SAM 3 compared to human performance?

On the SA-Co/Gold benchmark with triple human annotation:

- **Human lower bound**: 74.2 CGF1 (most conservative annotator)
- **SAM 3 performance**: 65.0 CGF1
- **Achievement**: **88%** of estimated human lower bound
- **Human upper bound**: 81.4 CGF1 (most liberal annotator)

SAM 3 achieves strong performance approaching human-level accuracy on open-vocabulary concept segmentation, with the gap primarily on ambiguous or subjective concepts (e.g., "small window", "cozy room").

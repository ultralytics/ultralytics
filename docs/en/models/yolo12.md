# YOLO12: Attention-Centric Object Detection

## Overview

YOLO12 introduces an attention-centric architecture that departs from the traditional CNN-based approaches used in previous YOLO models, yet retains the real-time inference speed essential for many applications. This model achieves state-of-the-art object detection accuracy through novel methodological innovations in attention mechanisms and overall network architecture, while maintaining real-time performance.

## Key Features

- **Area Attention Mechanism**: A new self-attention approach that processes large receptive fields efficiently. It divides [feature maps](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/feature-maps) into _l_ equal-sized regions (defaulting to 4), either horizontally or vertically, avoiding complex operations and maintaining a large effective receptive field. This significantly reduces computational cost compared to standard self-attention.
- **Residual Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (R-ELAN)**: An improved feature aggregation module based on ELAN, designed to address optimization challenges, especially in larger-scale attention-centric models. R-ELAN introduces:
    - Block-level residual connections with scaling (similar to layer scaling).
    - A redesigned feature aggregation method creating a bottleneck-like structure.
- **Optimized Attention Architecture**: YOLO12 streamlines the standard attention mechanism for greater efficiency and compatibility with the YOLO framework. This includes:
    - Using FlashAttention to minimize memory access overhead.
    - Removing positional encoding for a cleaner and faster model.
    - Adjusting the MLP ratio (from the typical 4 to 1.2 or 2) to better balance computation between attention and feed-forward layers.
    - Reducing the depth of stacked blocks for improved optimization.
    - Leveraging convolution operations (where appropriate) for their computational efficiency.
    - Adding a 7x7 separable convolution (the "position perceiver") to the attention mechanism to implicitly encode positional information.
- **Comprehensive Task Support**: YOLO12 supports a range of core computer vision tasks: object detection, [instance segmentation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/instance-segmentation), [image classification](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/image-classification), pose estimation, and oriented object detection (OBB).
- **Enhanced Efficiency**: Achieves higher accuracy with fewer parameters compared to many prior models, demonstrating an improved balance between speed and accuracy.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Designed for deployment across diverse platforms, from edge devices to cloud infrastructure.

## FAQ

### How does YOLO12 achieve real-time object detection while maintaining high accuracy?

YOLO12 incorporates several key innovations to balance speed and accuracy. The Area [Attention mechanism](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/attention-mechanism) efficiently processes large receptive fields, reducing computational cost compared to standard self-attention. The Residual Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (R-ELAN) improve feature aggregation, addressing optimization challenges in larger attention-centric models. Optimized Attention Architecture, including the use of FlashAttention and removal of positional encoding, further enhances efficiency. These features allow YOLO12 to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining the real-time inference speed crucial for many applications.

### What [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) tasks does YOLO12 support?

YOLO12 is a versatile model that supports a wide range of core computer vision tasks. It excels in object [detection](../tasks/detect.md), instance [segmentation](../tasks/segment.md), image [classification](../tasks/classify.md), [pose estimation](../tasks/pose.md), and oriented object detection (OBB) ([see details](../tasks/obb.md)). This comprehensive task support makes YOLO12 a powerful tool for diverse applications, from [robotics](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/robotics) and autonomous driving to medical imaging and industrial inspection. Each of these tasks can be performed in Inference, Validation, Training, and Export modes.

### How does YOLO12 compare to other YOLO models and competitors like RT-DETR?

YOLO12 demonstrates significant accuracy improvements across all model scales compared to prior YOLO models like YOLOv10 and YOLOv11, with some trade-offs in speed compared to the _fastest_ prior models. For example, YOLO12n achieves a +2.1% mAP improvement over YOLOv10n and +1.2% over YOLOv11n on the COCO val2017 dataset. Compared to models like [RT-DETR](https://docs.ultralytics.com/compare/yolov8-vs-rtdetr/), YOLO12s offers a +1.5% mAP improvement and a substantial +42% speed increase. These metrics highlight YOLO12's strong balance between accuracy and efficiency. See the [performance metrics section](#performance-metrics) for detailed comparisons.

### What are the hardware requirements for running YOLO12, especially for using FlashAttention?

By default, the Ultralytics YOLO12 implementation does _not_ require FlashAttention. However, FlashAttention can be optionally compiled and used with YOLO12 to minimize memory access overhead.

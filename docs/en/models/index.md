## Getting Started: Usage Examples

This example provides simple YOLO training and inference examples. For full documentation on these and other [modes](../modes/index.md) see the [Predict](../modes/predict.md), [Train](../modes/train.md), [Val](../modes/val.md) and [Export](../modes/export.md) docs pages.

Note the below example is for YOLOv8 [Detect](../tasks/detect.md) models for [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection). For additional supported tasks see the [Segment](../tasks/segment.md), [Classify](../tasks/classify.md) and [Pose](../tasks/pose.md) docs.

!!! example

    === "Python"

        [PyTorch](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/pytorch) pretrained `*.pt` models as well as configuration `*.yaml` files can be passed to the `YOLO()`, `SAM()`, `NAS()` and `RTDETR()` classes to create a model instance in Python:

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a COCO-pretrained YOLOv8n model
        model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

        # Display model information (optional)
        model.info()

        # Train the model on the COCO8 example dataset for 100 epochs
        results = model.train(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)

        # Run inference with the YOLOv8n model on the 'bus.jpg' image
        results = model("path/to/bus.jpg")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        CLI commands are available to directly run the models:

        ```bash
        # Load a COCO-pretrained YOLOv8n model and train it on the COCO8 example dataset for 100 epochs
        yolo train model=yolov8n.pt data=coco8.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=640

        # Load a COCO-pretrained YOLOv8n model and run inference on the 'bus.jpg' image
        yolo predict model=yolov8n.pt source=path/to/bus.jpg
        ```

# Object Detection Datasets Overview

Training a robust and accurate [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) model requires a comprehensive dataset. This guide introduces various formats of datasets that are compatible with the Ultralytics YOLO model and provides insights into their structure, usage, and how to convert between different formats.

## Supported Dataset Formats

### Ultralytics YOLO format

The Ultralytics YOLO format is a dataset configuration format that allows you to define the dataset root directory, the relative paths to training/validation/testing image directories or `*.txt` files containing image paths, and a dictionary of class names. Here is an example:

```yaml
# Train/val/test sets as 1) dir: path/to/imgs, 2) file: path/to/imgs.txt, or 3) list: [path/to/imgs1, path/to/imgs2, ..]
path: ../datasets/coco8 # dataset root dir
train: images/train # train images (relative to 'path') 4 images
val: images/val # val images (relative to 'path') 4 images
test: # test images (optional)

# Classes (80 COCO classes)
names:
    0: person
    1: bicycle
    2: car
    # ...
    77: teddy bear
    78: hair drier
    79: toothbrush
```

Labels for this format should be exported to YOLO format with one `*.txt` file per image. If there are no objects in an image, no `*.txt` file is required. The `*.txt` file should be formatted with one row per object in `class x_center y_center width height` format. Box coordinates must be in **normalized xywh** format (from 0 to 1). If your boxes are in pixels, you should divide `x_center` and `width` by image width, and `y_center` and `height` by image height. Class numbers should be zero-indexed (start with 0).

The label file corresponding to the above image contains 2 persons (class `0`) and a tie (class `27`):

When using the Ultralytics YOLO format, organize your training and validation images and labels as shown in the [COCO8 dataset](coco8.md) example below.

## Usage

Here's how you can use these formats to train your model:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)

        # Train the model
        results = model.train(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Start training from a pretrained *.pt model

### Adding your own dataset

If you have your own dataset and would like to use it for training detection models with Ultralytics YOLO format, ensure that it follows the format specified above under "Ultralytics YOLO format". Convert your annotations to the required format and specify the paths, number of classes, and class names in the YAML configuration file.

## Port or Convert Label Formats

### COCO Dataset Format to YOLO Format

You can easily convert labels from the popular COCO dataset format to the YOLO format using the following code snippet:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics.data.converter import convert_coco

        convert_coco(labels_dir="path/to/coco/annotations/")
        ```

This conversion tool can be used to convert the COCO dataset or any dataset in the COCO format to the Ultralytics YOLO format.

Remember to double-check if the dataset you want to use is compatible with your model and follows the necessary format conventions. Properly formatted datasets are crucial for training successful object detection models.

## FAQ

### What is the Ultralytics YOLO dataset format and how to structure it?

The Ultralytics YOLO format is a structured configuration for defining datasets in your training projects. It involves setting paths to your training, validation, and testing images and corresponding labels. For example:

```yaml
path: ../datasets/coco8 # dataset root directory
train: images/train # training images (relative to 'path')
val: images/val # validation images (relative to 'path')
test: # optional test images
names:
    0: person
    1: bicycle
    2: car
    # ...
```

Labels are saved in `*.txt` files with one file per image, formatted as `class x_center y_center width height` with normalized coordinates. For a detailed guide, see the [COCO8 dataset example](coco8.md).

### How do I convert a COCO dataset to the YOLO format?

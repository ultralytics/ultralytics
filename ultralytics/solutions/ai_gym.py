class AIGym(BaseSolution):
    """
    A class to manage gym steps of people in a real-time video stream based on their poses.

    This class extends BaseSolution to monitor workouts using YOLO pose estimation models. It tracks and counts
    repetitions of exercises based on predefined angle thresholds for up and down positions.

    Attributes:
        count (List[int]): Repetition counts for each detected person.
        angle (List[float]): Current angle of the tracked body part for each person.
        stage (List[str]): Current exercise stage ('up', 'down', or '-') for each person.
        initial_stage (str | None): Initial stage of the exercise.
        up_angle (float): Angle threshold for considering the 'up' position of an exercise.
        down_angle (float): Angle threshold for considering the 'down' position of an exercise.
        kpts (List[int]): Indices of keypoints used for angle calculation.

    Methods:
        process: Processes a frame to detect poses, calculate angles, and count repetitions.

    Examples:
        >>> gym = AIGym(model="yolo11n-pose.pt")
        >>> image = cv2.imread("gym_scene.jpg")
        >>> results = gym.process(image)
        >>> processed_image = results.plot_im
        >>> cv2.imshow("Processed Image", processed_image)
        >>> cv2.waitKey(0)

        Args:

        This function processes an input image to track and analyze human poses for workout monitoring. It uses

        angle thresholds.

        Args:
            im0 (np.ndarray): Input image for processing.

        Returns:

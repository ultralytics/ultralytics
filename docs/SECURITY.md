# Security Policy

At [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com), the security of our users' data and systems is of utmost importance. To
ensure the safety and security of our [open-source projects](https://github.com/ultralytics), we have implemented
several measures to detect and prevent security vulnerabilities.

## Snyk Scanning

We use [Snyk](https://snyk.io/advisor/python/ultralytics) to regularly scan the YOLOv8 repository for vulnerabilities
and security issues. Our goal is to identify and remediate any potential threats as soon as possible, to minimize any
risks to our users.

## GitHub CodeQL Scanning

In addition to our Snyk scans, we also use
GitHub's [CodeQL](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning-with-codeql)
scans to proactively identify and address security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you suspect or discover a security vulnerability in the YOLOv8 repository, please let us know immediately. You can
reach out to us directly via our [contact form](https://ultralytics.com/contact) or
via [security@ultralytics.com](mailto:security@ultralytics.com). Our security team will investigate and respond as soon
as possible.

We appreciate your help in keeping the YOLOv8 repository secure and safe for everyone.

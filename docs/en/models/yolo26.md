# Ultralytics YOLO26

!!! note "Preview Only ‚ö†Ô∏è"

    üöß YOLO26 models are still under development and not yet released. Performance numbers shown here are **previews only**.  
    Final downloads and releases will follow soon ‚Äî stay updated via [YOLO Vision 2025](https://www.ultralytics.com/events/yolovision).

## Overview

[Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) YOLO26 is the latest evolution in the YOLO series of real-time object detectors, engineered from the ground up for **edge and low-power devices**. It introduces a streamlined design that removes unnecessary complexity while integrating targeted innovations to deliver faster, lighter, and more accessible deployment.

The architecture of YOLO26 is guided by three core principles:

- **Simplicity:** YOLO26 is a **native end-to-end model**, producing predictions directly without the need for non-maximum suppression (NMS). By eliminating this post-processing step, inference becomes faster, lighter, and easier to deploy in real-world systems. This breakthrough approach was first pioneered in [YOLOv10](../models/yolov10.md) by Ao Wang at Tsinghua University and has been further advanced in YOLO26.  
- **Deployment Efficiency:** The end-to-end design cuts out an entire stage of the pipeline, dramatically simplifying integration, reducing latency, and making deployment more robust across diverse environments.  
- **Training Innovation:** YOLO26 introduces the **MuSGD optimizer**, a hybrid of [SGD](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.SGD.html) and [Muon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16982) ‚Äî inspired by Moonshot AI‚Äôs [Kimi K2](https://kimi.moonshot.cn/) breakthroughs in LLM training. This optimizer brings enhanced stability and faster convergence, transferring optimization advances from language models into computer vision.  

Together, these innovations deliver a model family that achieves higher accuracy on small objects, provides seamless deployment, and runs **up to 43% faster on CPUs** ‚Äî making YOLO26 one of the most practical and deployable YOLO models to date for resource-constrained environments.

## Key Features

- **DFL Removal**  
  The Distribution Focal Loss (DFL) module, while effective, often complicated export and limited hardware compatibility. YOLO26 removes DFL entirely, simplifying inference and broadening support for **edge and low-power devices**.  

- **End-to-End NMS-Free Inference**  
  Unlike traditional detectors that rely on NMS as a separate post-processing step, YOLO26 is **natively end-to-end**. Predictions are generated directly, reducing latency and making integration into production systems faster, lighter, and more reliable.  

- **ProgLoss + STAL**  
  Improved loss functions increase detection accuracy, with notable improvements in **small-object recognition**, a critical requirement for IoT, robotics, aerial imagery, and other edge applications.  

- **MuSGD Optimizer**  
  A new hybrid optimizer that combines [SGD](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.SGD.html) with [Muon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16982). Inspired by Moonshot AI‚Äôs [Kimi K2](https://kimi.moonshot.cn/), MuSGD introduces advanced optimization methods from LLM training into computer vision, enabling more stable training and faster convergence.  

- **Up to 43% Faster CPU Inference**  
  Specifically optimized for edge computing, YOLO26 delivers significantly faster CPU inference, ensuring real-time performance on devices without GPUs.

# Transfer Learning with Frozen Layers in YOLOv5

ðŸ“š This guide explains how to **freeze** [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) ðŸš€ layers when implementing [transfer learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/transfer-learning). Transfer learning is a powerful [machine learning (ML)](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml) technique that allows you to quickly retrain a model on new data without retraining the entire network from scratch. By freezing the weights of initial layers and only updating the parameters of later layers, you can significantly reduce computational resource requirements and training time. However, this approach might slightly impact the final model [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy).

## Before You Start

First, clone the YOLOv5 repository and install the necessary dependencies listed in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/requirements.txt). Ensure you have a [**Python>=3.8.0**](https://www.python.org/) environment with [**PyTorch>=1.8**](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) installed. Pre-trained [models](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/models) and required [datasets](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/data) will be downloaded automatically from the latest YOLOv5 [release](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 # clone repository
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt # install dependencies
```

## How Layer Freezing Works

When you freeze layers in a [neural network](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/neural-network-nn), you prevent their parameters (weights and biases) from being updated during the training process. In PyTorch, this is achieved by setting the `requires_grad` attribute of the layer's tensors to `False`. Consequently, gradients are not computed for these layers during [backpropagation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/backpropagation), saving computation and memory.

Here's how YOLOv5 implements layer freezing in its [training script](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/train.py):

```python
# Freeze specified layers
freeze = [f"model.{x}." for x in range(freeze)]  # Define layers to freeze based on module index
for k, v in model.named_parameters():
    v.requires_grad = True  # Ensure all parameters are initially trainable
    if any(x in k for x in freeze):
        print(f"Freezing layer: {k}")
        v.requires_grad = False  # Disable gradient calculation for frozen layers
```

## Exploring Model Architecture

Understanding the structure of the YOLOv5 model is crucial for deciding which layers to freeze. You can inspect the names of all modules and their parameters using the following Python snippet:

```python
# Assuming 'model' is your loaded YOLOv5 model instance
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    print(name)

"""
Example Output:
model.0.conv.conv.weight
model.0.conv.bn.weight
model.0.conv.bn.bias
model.1.conv.weight
model.1.bn.weight
model.1.bn.bias
model.2.cv1.conv.weight
model.2.cv1.bn.weight
...
"""
```

The YOLOv5 architecture typically consists of a [backbone](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/backbone) (layers 0-9 in standard configurations like YOLOv5s/m/l/x) responsible for [feature extraction](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/feature-extraction), and a head (the remaining layers) which performs [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection).

```yaml
# Example YOLOv5 v6.0 backbone structure
backbone:
    # [from, number, module, args]
    - [-1, 1, Conv, [64, 6, 2, 2]]  # Layer 0: Initial convolution (P1/2 stride)
    - [-1, 1, Conv, [128, 3, 2]] # Layer 1: Downsampling convolution (P2/4 stride)
    - [-1, 3, C3, [128]]          # Layer 2: C3 module
    - [-1, 1, Conv, [256, 3, 2]] # Layer 3: Downsampling convolution (P3/8 stride)
    - [-1, 6, C3, [256]]          # Layer 4: C3 module
    - [-1, 1, Conv, [512, 3, 2]] # Layer 5: Downsampling convolution (P4/16 stride)
    - [-1, 9, C3, [512]]          # Layer 6: C3 module
    - [-1, 1, Conv, [1024, 3, 2]]# Layer 7: Downsampling convolution (P5/32 stride)
    - [-1, 3, C3, [1024]]         # Layer 8: C3 module
    - [-1, 1, SPPF, [1024, 5]]    # Layer 9: Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast

# Example YOLOv5 v6.0 head structure
head:
    - [-1, 1, Conv, [512, 1, 1]] # Layer 10
    - [-1, 1, nn.Upsample, [None, 2, "nearest"]] # Layer 11
    - [[-1, 6], 1, Concat, [1]] # Layer 12: Concatenate with backbone P4 (from layer 6)
    - [-1, 3, C3, [512, False]] # Layer 13: C3 module
    # ... subsequent head layers for feature fusion and detection
```

## Freezing Options

You can control which layers are frozen using the `--freeze` argument in the training command. This argument specifies the index of the first _unfrozen_ module; all modules before this index will have their weights frozen.

### Freeze Backbone Only

To freeze the entire backbone (layers 0 through 9), which is common when adapting the model to new object classes while retaining general feature extraction capabilities learned from a large dataset like [COCO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco/):

```bash
python train.py --weights yolov5m.pt --data your_dataset.yaml --freeze 10
```

This strategy is effective when your target dataset shares similar low-level visual features (edges, textures) with the original training data (e.g., COCO) but contains different object categories.

### Freeze All Except Final Detection Layers

To freeze almost the entire network, leaving only the final output convolution layers (part of the `Detect` module, typically the last module, e.g., module 24 in YOLOv5s) trainable:

```bash
python train.py --weights yolov5m.pt --data your_dataset.yaml --freeze 24
```

This approach is useful when you primarily need to adjust the model for a different number of output classes while keeping the vast majority of learned features intact. It requires the least computational resources for [fine-tuning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/fine-tuning).

## Performance Comparison

To illustrate the effects of freezing layers, we trained YOLOv5m on the [Pascal VOC dataset](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/voc/) for 50 [epochs](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/epoch), starting from the official COCO pre-trained [weights](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/model-weights) (`yolov5m.pt`). We compared three scenarios: training all layers (`--freeze 0`), freezing the backbone (`--freeze 10`), and freezing all but the final detection layers (`--freeze 24`).

```bash
# Example command for training with backbone frozen
python train.py --batch 48 --weights yolov5m.pt --data voc.yaml --epochs 50 --cache --img 512 --hyp hyp.finetune.yaml --freeze 10
```

### Accuracy Results

The results show that freezing layers can accelerate training significantly but may lead to a slight reduction in final [mAP (mean Average Precision)](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/mean-average-precision-map). Training all layers generally yields the best accuracy, while freezing more layers offers faster training at the cost of potentially lower performance.

### Resource Utilization

Freezing more layers substantially reduces [GPU](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/gpu-graphics-processing-unit) memory requirements and overall utilization. This makes transfer learning with frozen layers an attractive option when working with limited hardware resources, allowing for training larger models or using larger image sizes than might otherwise be possible.

## When to Use Layer Freezing

Layer freezing during transfer learning is particularly advantageous in several situations:

1.  **Limited Computational Resources**: If you have constraints on GPU memory or processing power.
2.  **Small Datasets**: When your target dataset is significantly smaller than the original pre-training dataset, freezing helps prevent [overfitting](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/overfitting).
3.  **Rapid Prototyping**: When you need to quickly adapt an existing model to a new task or domain for initial evaluation.
4.  **Similar Feature Domains**: If the low-level features in your new dataset are very similar to those in the dataset the model was pre-trained on.

## Parking Management System Code Workflow

??? note "Points selection is now easy"

    Choosing parking points is a critical and complex task in parking management systems. Ultralytics streamlines this process by providing a tool "Parking slots annotator" that lets you define parking lot areas, which can be utilized later for additional processing.

**Step-1:** Capture a frame from the video or camera stream where you want to manage the parking lot.

**Step-2:** Use the provided code to launch a graphical interface, where you can select an image and start outlining parking regions by mouse click to create polygons.

!!! example "Parking slots annotator Ultralytics YOLO"

    ??? note "Additional step for installing `tkinter`"

        Generally, `tkinter` comes pre-packaged with Python. However, if it did not, you can install it using the highlighted steps:

        - **Linux**: (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt install python3-tk`
        - **Fedora**: `sudo dnf install python3-tkinter`
        - **Arch**: `sudo pacman -S tk`
        - **Windows**: Reinstall Python and enable the checkbox `tcl/tk and IDLE` on **Optional Features** during installation
        - **MacOS**: Reinstall Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/) or `brew install python-tk`

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import solutions

        solutions.ParkingPtsSelection()
        ```

**Step-3:** After defining the parking areas with polygons, click `save` to store a JSON file with the data in your working directory.

**Step-4:** You can now utilize the provided code for parking management with Ultralytics YOLO.

!!! example "Parking Management using Ultralytics YOLO"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        import cv2

        from ultralytics import solutions

        # Video capture
        cap = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/video.mp4")
        assert cap.isOpened(), "Error reading video file"

        # Video writer
        w, h, fps = (int(cap.get(x)) for x in (cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))
        video_writer = cv2.VideoWriter("parking management.avi", cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"mp4v"), fps, (w, h))

        # Initialize parking management object
        parkingmanager = solutions.ParkingManagement(
            model="yolo11n.pt",  # path to model file
            json_file="bounding_boxes.json",  # path to parking annotations file
        )

        while cap.isOpened():
            ret, im0 = cap.read()
            if not ret:
                break

            results = parkingmanager(im0)

            # print(results)  # access the output

            video_writer.write(results.plot_im)  # write the processed frame.

        cap.release()
        video_writer.release()
        cv2.destroyAllWindows()  # destroy all opened windows
        ```

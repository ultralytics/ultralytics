# Ultralytics HUB Quickstart

[Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing users to quickly upload their datasets and train new YOLO models. It also offers a range of pre-trained models to choose from, making it extremely easy for users to get started. Once a model is trained, it can be effortlessly previewed in the [Ultralytics HUB App](app/index.md) before being deployed for real-time classification, [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection), and [instance segmentation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/instance-segmentation) tasks.

## FAQ

### What is Ultralytics YOLO and how does it benefit my [machine learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml) projects?

Ultralytics YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) model. Its latest version, YOLO26, delivers faster, lighter, end-to-end NMS-free inference optimized for edge and low-power devices, making it ideal for a wide range of applications, from real-time video analytics to advanced machine learning research. YOLO's efficiency in detecting objects in images and videos has made it the go-to solution for businesses and researchers looking to integrate robust [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) capabilities into their projects.

For more details on YOLO26, visit the [YOLO26 documentation](../models/yolo26.md).

### How do I contribute to Ultralytics YOLO repositories?

Contributing to Ultralytics YOLO repositories is straightforward. Start by reviewing the [Contributing Guide](contributing.md) to understand the protocols for submitting pull requests, reporting bugs, and more. You'll also need to sign the [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](CLA.md) to ensure your contributions are legally recognized. For effective bug reporting, refer to the [Minimum Reproducible Example (MRE) Guide](minimum-reproducible-example.md).

### Why should I use Ultralytics Platform for my machine learning projects?

Ultralytics Platform offers a seamless, no-code solution for managing your machine learning projects. It enables you to generate, train, and deploy AI models like YOLO26 effortlessly. Unique features include cloud training, real-time tracking, and intuitive dataset management. Ultralytics Platform simplifies the entire workflow, from data processing to [model deployment](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/model-deployment), making it an indispensable tool for both beginners and advanced users.

To get started, visit [Ultralytics Platform Quickstart](../platform/quickstart.md).

### What is Continuous Integration (CI) in Ultralytics, and how does it ensure high-quality code?

Continuous Integration (CI) in Ultralytics involves automated processes that ensure the integrity and quality of the codebase. Our CI setup includes Docker deployment, broken link checks, [CodeQL analysis](https://github.com/github/codeql), and PyPI publishing. These processes help maintain stable and secure repositories by automatically running tests and checks on new code submissions.

Learn more in the [Continuous Integration (CI) Guide](CI.md).

### How is [data privacy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/data-privacy) handled by Ultralytics?

Ultralytics takes data privacy seriously. Our [Privacy Policy](privacy.md) outlines how we collect and use anonymized data to improve the YOLO package while prioritizing user privacy and control. We adhere to strict data protection regulations to ensure your information is secure at all times.

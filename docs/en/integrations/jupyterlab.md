# A Guide on How to Use JupyterLab to Train Your YOLO11 Models

Building [deep learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/deep-learning-dl) models can be tough, especially when you don't have the right tools or environment to work with. If you are facing this issue, JupyterLab might be the right solution for you. JupyterLab is a user-friendly, web-based platform that makes coding more flexible and interactive. You can use it to handle big datasets, create complex models, and even collaborate with others, all in one place.

You can use JupyterLab to [work on projects](../guides/steps-of-a-cv-project.md) related to [Ultralytics YOLO11 models](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). JupyterLab is a great option for efficient model development and experimentation. It makes it easy to start experimenting with and [training YOLO11 models](../modes/train.md) right from your computer. Let's dive deeper into JupyterLab, its key features, and how you can use it to train YOLO11 models.

## What is JupyterLab?

JupyterLab is an open-source web-based platform designed for working with Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. It's an upgrade from the traditional Jupyter Notebook interface that provides a more versatile and powerful user experience.

JupyterLab allows you to work with notebooks, text editors, terminals, and other tools all in one place. Its flexible design lets you organize your workspace to fit your needs and makes it easier to perform tasks like data analysis, visualization, and [machine learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml). JupyterLab also supports real-time collaboration, making it ideal for team projects in research and data science.

## Key Features of JupyterLab

Here are some of the key features that make JupyterLab a great option for model development and experimentation:

- **All-in-One Workspace**: JupyterLab is a one-stop shop for all your data science needs. Unlike the classic Jupyter Notebook, which had separate interfaces for text editing, terminal access, and notebooks, JupyterLab integrates all these features into a single, cohesive environment. You can view and edit various file formats, including JPEG, PDF, and CSV, directly within JupyterLab. An all-in-one workspace lets you access everything you need at your fingertips, streamlining your workflow and saving you time.
- **Flexible Layouts**: One of JupyterLab's standout features is its flexible layout. You can drag, drop, and resize tabs to create a personalized layout that helps you work more efficiently. The collapsible left sidebar keeps essential tabs like the file browser, running kernels, and command palette within easy reach. You can have multiple windows open at once, allowing you to multitask and manage your projects more effectively.
- **Interactive Code Consoles**: Code consoles in JupyterLab provide an interactive space to test out snippets of code or functions. They also serve as a log of computations made within a notebook. Creating a new console for a notebook and viewing all kernel activity is straightforward. This feature is especially useful when you're experimenting with new ideas or troubleshooting issues in your code.
- **Markdown Preview**: Working with Markdown files is more efficient in JupyterLab, thanks to its simultaneous preview feature. As you write or edit your Markdown file, you can see the formatted output in real-time. It makes it easier to double-check that your documentation looks perfect, saving you from having to switch back and forth between editing and preview modes.
- **Run Code from Text Files**: If you're sharing a text file with code, JupyterLab makes it easy to run it directly within the platform. You can highlight the code and press Shift + Enter to execute it. It is great for verifying code snippets quickly and helps guarantee that the code you share is functional and error-free.

## Why Should You Use JupyterLab for Your YOLO11 Projects?

There are multiple platforms for developing and evaluating machine learning models, so what makes JupyterLab stand out? Let's explore some of the unique aspects that JupyterLab offers for your machine-learning projects:

- **Easy Cell Management**: Managing cells in JupyterLab is a breeze. Instead of the cumbersome cut-and-paste method, you can simply drag and drop cells to rearrange them.
- **Cross-Notebook Cell Copying**: JupyterLab makes it simple to copy cells between different notebooks. You can drag and drop cells from one notebook to another.
- **Easy Switch to Classic Notebook View**: For those who miss the classic Jupyter Notebook interface, JupyterLab offers an easy switch back. Simply replace `/lab` in the URL with `/tree` to return to the familiar notebook view.
- **Multiple Views**: JupyterLab supports multiple views of the same notebook, which is particularly useful for long notebooks. You can open different sections side-by-side for comparison or exploration, and any changes made in one view are reflected in the other.
- **Customizable Themes**: JupyterLab includes a built-in Dark theme for the notebook, which is perfect for late-night coding sessions. There are also themes available for the text editor and terminal, allowing you to customize the appearance of your entire workspace.

## Common Issues While Working with JupyterLab

When working with JupyterLab, you might come across some common issues. Here are some tips to help you navigate the platform smoothly:

- **Managing Kernels**: Kernels are crucial because they manage the connection between the code you write in JupyterLab and the environment where it runs. They can also access and share data between notebooks. When you close a Jupyter Notebook, the kernel might still be running because other notebooks could be using it. If you want to completely shut down a kernel, you can select it, right-click, and choose "Shut Down Kernel" from the pop-up menu.
- **Installing Python Packages**: Sometimes, you might need additional Python packages that aren't pre-installed on the server. You can easily install these packages in your home directory or a virtual environment by using the command `python -m pip install package-name`. To see all installed packages, use `python -m pip list`.
- **Deploying Flask/FastAPI API to Posit Connect**: You can deploy your Flask and FastAPI APIs to Posit Connect using the [rsconnect-python](https://docs.posit.co/rsconnect-python/) package from the terminal. Doing so makes it easier to integrate your web applications with JupyterLab and share them with others.
- **Installing JupyterLab Extensions**: JupyterLab supports various extensions to enhance functionality. You can install and customize these extensions to suit your needs. For detailed instructions, refer to [JupyterLab Extensions Guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/extensions.html) for more information.
- **Using Multiple Versions of Python**: If you need to work with different versions of Python, you can use Jupyter kernels configured with different Python versions.

    - Adjust [batch size](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/batch-size) or image size to fit your GPU memory.

2. Package conflicts:

    - Create a separate conda environment for your YOLO11 projects to avoid conflicts.
    - Use `!pip install package_name` in a notebook cell to install missing packages.

3. Kernel crashes:
    - Restart the kernel and run cells one by one to identify the problematic code.
    - Check for memory leaks in your code, especially when processing large datasets.

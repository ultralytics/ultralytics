# YOLOv8 OpenVINO Inference in C++ ü¶æ

Welcome to the YOLOv8 OpenVINO Inference example in C++! This guide will help you get started with leveraging the powerful YOLOv8 models using OpenVINO and OpenCV API in your C++ projects. Whether you're looking to enhance performance or add flexibility to your applications, this example has got you covered.

## üåü Features

- üöÄ **Model Format Support**: Compatible with `ONNX` and `OpenVINO IR` formats.
- ‚ö° **Precision Options**: Run models in `FP32`, `FP16`, and `INT8` precisions.
- üîÑ **Dynamic Shape Loading**: Easily handle models with dynamic input shapes.

## üìã Dependencies

To ensure smooth execution, please make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

| Dependency | Version  |
| ---------- | -------- |
| OpenVINO   | >=2023.3 |
| OpenCV     | >=4.5.0  |
| C++        | >=14     |
| CMake      | >=3.12.0 |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build Instructions

Follow these steps to build the project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics.git
   cd ultralytics/YOLOv8-OpenVINO-CPP-Inference
   ```

2. Create a build directory and compile the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Once built, you can run inference on an image using the following command:

```bash
./detect <model_path.{onnx, xml}> <image_path.jpg>
```

## üîÑ Exporting YOLOv8 Models

To use your YOLOv8 model with OpenVINO, you need to export it first. Use the command below to export the model:

```bash
yolo export model=yolov8s.pt imgsz=640 format=openvino
```

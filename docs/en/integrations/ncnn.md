# How to Export to NCNN from YOLO11 for Smooth Deployment

Deploying [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) models on devices with limited computational power, such as mobile or embedded systems, can be tricky. You need to make sure you use a format optimized for optimal performance. This makes sure that even devices with limited processing power can handle advanced computer vision tasks well.

The export to NCNN format feature allows you to optimize your [Ultralytics YOLO11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) models for lightweight device-based applications. In this guide, we'll walk you through how to convert your models to the NCNN format, making it easier for your models to perform well on various mobile and embedded devices.

## Why should you export to NCNN?

The [NCNN](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn) framework, developed by Tencent, is a high-performance [neural network](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/neural-network-nn) inference computing framework optimized specifically for mobile platforms, including mobile phones, embedded devices, and IoT devices. NCNN is compatible with a wide range of platforms, including Linux, Android, iOS, and macOS.

NCNN is known for its fast processing speed on mobile CPUs and enables rapid deployment of [deep learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/deep-learning-dl) models to mobile platforms. This makes it easier to build smart apps, putting the power of AI right at your fingertips.

## Key Features of NCNN Models

NCNN models offer a wide range of key features that enable on-device [machine learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml) by helping developers run their models on mobile, embedded, and edge devices:

- **Efficient and High-Performance**: NCNN models are made to be efficient and lightweight, optimized for running on mobile and embedded devices like Raspberry Pi with limited resources. They can also achieve high performance with high [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy) on various computer vision-based tasks.

- **Quantization**: NCNN models often support quantization which is a technique that reduces the [precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/precision) of the model's weights and activations. This leads to further improvements in performance and reduces memory footprint.

- **Compatibility**: NCNN models are compatible with popular deep learning frameworks like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Caffe](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/), and [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/). This compatibility allows developers to use existing models and workflows easily.

- **Easy to Use**: NCNN models are designed for easy integration into various applications, thanks to their compatibility with popular deep learning frameworks. Additionally, NCNN offers user-friendly tools for converting models between different formats, ensuring smooth interoperability across the development landscape.

## Deployment Options with NCNN

Before we look at the code for exporting YOLO11 models to the NCNN format, let's understand how NCNN models are normally used.

NCNN models, designed for efficiency and performance, are compatible with a variety of deployment platforms:

- **Mobile Deployment**: Specifically optimized for Android and iOS, allowing for seamless integration into mobile applications for efficient on-device inference.

- **Embedded Systems and IoT Devices**: If you find that running inference on a Raspberry Pi with the [Ultralytics Guide](../guides/raspberry-pi.md) isn't fast enough, switching to an NCNN exported model could help speed things up. NCNN is great for devices like Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson, especially in situations where you need quick processing right on the device.

- **Desktop and Server Deployment**: Capable of being deployed in desktop and server environments across Linux, Windows, and macOS, supporting development, training, and evaluation with higher computational capacities.

          from ultralytics import YOLO

          # Load the YOLO11 model
          model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

          # Export the model to NCNN format
          model.export(format="ncnn")  # creates '/yolo11n_ncnn_model'

          # Load the exported NCNN model
          ncnn_model = YOLO("./yolo11n_ncnn_model")

          # Run inference
          results = ncnn_model("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")
          ```

    === "CLI"

          ```bash
          # Export a YOLO11n PyTorch model to NCNN format
          yolo export model=yolo11n.pt format=ncnn  # creates '/yolo11n_ncnn_model'

          # Run inference with the exported model
          yolo predict model='./yolo11n_ncnn_model' source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg'

## FAQ

### How do I train a custom object detection model using Ultralytics YOLO?

Training a custom object detection model with Ultralytics YOLO is straightforward. Start by preparing your dataset in the correct format and installing the Ultralytics package. Use the following code to initiate training:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")  # Load a pre-trained YOLO model
        model.train(data="path/to/dataset.yaml", epochs=50)  # Train on custom dataset
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolo11n.pt data=path/to/dataset.yaml epochs=50
        ```

For detailed dataset formatting and additional options, refer to our [Tips for Model Training](model-training-tips.md) guide.

### What performance metrics should I use to evaluate my YOLO model?

Evaluating your YOLO model performance is crucial to understanding its efficacy. Key metrics include [Mean Average Precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/mean-average-precision-map) (mAP), [Intersection over Union](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/intersection-over-union-iou) (IoU), and F1 score. These metrics help assess the accuracy and [precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/precision) of object detection tasks. You can learn more about these metrics and how to improve your model in our [YOLO Performance Metrics](yolo-performance-metrics.md) guide.

### What are the common issues faced during YOLO model training, and how can I resolve them?

Common issues during YOLO model training include data formatting errors, model architecture mismatches, and insufficient [training data](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/training-data). To address these, ensure your dataset is correctly formatted, check for compatible model versions, and augment your training data. For a comprehensive list of solutions, refer to our [YOLO Common Issues](yolo-common-issues.md) guide.

### How can I deploy my YOLO model for real-time object detection on edge devices?

Deploying YOLO models on edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson and Raspberry Pi requires converting the model to a compatible format such as TensorRT or TFLite. Follow our step-by-step guides for [NVIDIA Jetson](nvidia-jetson.md) and [Raspberry Pi](raspberry-pi.md) deployments to get started with real-time object detection on edge hardware.

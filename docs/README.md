## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ultralytics?logo=pypi&logoColor=white)](https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/)
[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/ultralytics)](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/ultralytics)
[![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/ultralytics?logo=python&logoColor=gold)](https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/)

To install the `ultralytics` package in developer mode, which allows you to modify the source code directly, ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.9 or later installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the `ultralytics` repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the cloned repository's root directory:

    ```bash
    cd ultralytics
    ```

3.  Install the package in editable mode (`-e`) along with its development dependencies (`[dev]`) using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

    ```bash
    pip install -e '.[dev]'
    ```

    This command installs the `ultralytics` package such that changes to the source code are immediately reflected in your environment, ideal for development.

## üöÄ Building and Serving Locally

The `mkdocs serve` command builds and serves a local version of your [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) documentation. This is highly useful during development and testing to preview changes.

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

- **Command Breakdown:**
    - `mkdocs`: The main MkDocs command-line interface tool.
    - `serve`: The subcommand used to build and locally serve your documentation site.
- **Note:**
    - `mkdocs serve` includes live reloading, automatically updating the preview in your browser as you save changes to the documentation files.
    - To stop the local server, simply press `CTRL+C` in your terminal.

## üåç Building and Serving Multi-Language

If your documentation supports multiple languages, follow these steps to build and preview all versions:

1.  Stage all new or modified language Markdown (`.md`) files using Git:

    ```bash
    git add docs/**/*.md -f
    ```

2.  Build all language versions into the `/site` directory. This script ensures that relevant root-level files are included and clears the previous build:

    ```bash
    # Clear existing /site directory to prevent conflicts
    rm -rf site

    # Build the default language site using the primary config file
    mkdocs build -f docs/mkdocs.yml

    # Loop through each language-specific config file and build its site
    for file in docs/mkdocs_*.yml; do
      echo "Building MkDocs site with $file"
      mkdocs build -f "$file"
    done
    ```

3.  To preview the complete multi-language site locally, navigate into the build output directory and start a simple [Python HTTP server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html):
    ```bash
    cd site
    python -m http.server
    # Open http://localhost:8000 in your preferred web browser
    ```
    Access the live preview site at `http://localhost:8000`.

## üì§ Deploying Your Documentation Site

To deploy your MkDocs documentation site, choose a hosting provider and configure your deployment method. Common options include [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), GitLab Pages, or other static site hosting services.

- Configure deployment settings within your `mkdocs.yml` file.
- Use the `mkdocs deploy` command specific to your chosen provider to build and deploy your site.

* **GitHub Pages Deployment Example:**
  If deploying to GitHub Pages, you can use the built-in command:

    ```bash
    mkdocs gh-deploy
    ```

    After deployment, you might need to update the "Custom domain" settings in your repository's settings page if you wish to use a personalized URL.

- For detailed instructions on various deployment methods, consult the official [MkDocs Deploying your docs guide](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/).

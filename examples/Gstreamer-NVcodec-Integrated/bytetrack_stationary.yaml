# ByteTracker configuration optimized for stationary vehicle tracking
# Reduces ID switching for vehicles that remain in frame

# Tracker type (do not change)
tracker_type: bytetrack

# Detection association thresholds
track_high_thresh: 0.3    # Lower than default 0.5 - allows weaker detections to maintain tracks
track_low_thresh: 0.01    # Much lower than default 0.1 - second chance for very weak detections  
new_track_thresh: 0.4     # Lower than default 0.6 - easier to start new tracks

# Track persistence settings
track_buffer: 300          # Increased from default 30 - keep lost tracks alive longer
match_thresh: 0.7         # Higher than default 0.8 - stricter matching to prevent ID swaps

# Feature fusion (helps with ID consistency)
fuse_score: True          # Combines confidence scores with IoU for better matching

# Global Motion Compensation (helps with camera movement)
gmc_method: sparseOptFlow # Use sparse optical flow for motion compensation

# ReID settings (disabled for performance)

#proximity_thresh: 0.5     # Only used if ReID is enabled

### Unified Model Architecture

SAM 2 combines the capabilities of image and video segmentation in a single model. This unification simplifies deployment and allows for consistent performance across different media types. It leverages a flexible prompt-based interface, enabling users to specify objects of interest through various prompt types, such as points, bounding boxes, or masks.

### Real-Time Performance

The model achieves real-time inference speeds, processing approximately 44 frames per second. This makes SAM 2 suitable for applications requiring immediate feedback, such as video editing and augmented reality.

### Zero-Shot Generalization

SAM 2 can segment objects it has never encountered before, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization. This is particularly useful in diverse or evolving visual domains where pre-defined categories may not cover all possible objects.

### Interactive Refinement

Users can iteratively refine the segmentation results by providing additional prompts, allowing for precise control over the output. This interactivity is essential for fine-tuning results in applications like video annotation or medical imaging.

### Advanced Handling of Visual Challenges

SAM 2 includes mechanisms to manage common video segmentation challenges, such as object occlusion and reappearance. It uses a sophisticated memory mechanism to keep track of objects across frames, ensuring continuity even when objects are temporarily obscured or exit and re-enter the scene.

For a deeper understanding of SAM 2's architecture and capabilities, explore the [SAM 2 research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12741).

## Performance and Technical Details

SAM 2 sets a new benchmark in the field, outperforming previous models on various metrics:

| Metric                                                                                     | SAM 2         | Previous SOTA |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Interactive Video Segmentation**                                                         | **Best**      | -             |
| **Human Interactions Required**                                                            | **3x fewer**  | Baseline      |
| **[Image Segmentation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/image-segmentation) Accuracy** | **Improved**  | SAM           |
| **Inference Speed**                                                                        | **6x faster** | SAM           |

## Model Architecture

### Core Components

- **Image and Video Encoder**: Utilizes a [transformer](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/transformer)-based architecture to extract high-level features from both images and video frames. This component is responsible for understanding the visual content at each timestep.
- **Prompt Encoder**: Processes user-provided prompts (points, boxes, masks) to guide the segmentation task. This allows SAM 2 to adapt to user input and target specific objects within a scene.
- **Memory Mechanism**: Includes a memory encoder, memory bank, and memory attention module. These components collectively store and utilize information from past frames, enabling the model to maintain consistent object tracking over time.
- **Mask Decoder**: Generates the final segmentation masks based on the encoded image features and prompts. In video, it also uses memory context to ensure accurate tracking across frames.

![SAM 2 Architecture Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebookresearch/sam2/refs/heads/main/assets/model_diagram.png)

### Memory Mechanism and Occlusion Handling

The memory mechanism allows SAM 2 to handle temporal dependencies and occlusions in video data. As objects move and interact, SAM 2 records their features in a memory bank. When an object becomes occluded, the model can rely on this memory to predict its position and appearance when it reappears. The occlusion head specifically handles scenarios where objects are not visible, predicting the likelihood of an object being occluded.

### Multi-Mask Ambiguity Resolution

In situations with ambiguity (e.g., overlapping objects), SAM 2 can generate multiple mask predictions. This feature is crucial for accurately representing complex scenes where a single mask might not sufficiently describe the scene's nuances.

## SA-V Dataset

The SA-V dataset, developed for SAM 2's training, is one of the largest and most diverse video segmentation datasets available. It includes:

- **51,000+ Videos**: Captured across 47 countries, providing a wide range of real-world scenarios.
- **600,000+ Mask Annotations**: Detailed spatio-temporal mask annotations, referred to as "masklets," covering whole objects and parts.
- **Dataset Scale**: It features 4.5 times more videos and 53 times more annotations than previous largest datasets, offering unprecedented diversity and complexity.

## Benchmarks

        # Load a model
        model = SAM("sam2.1_b.pt")

        # Display model information (optional)
        model.info()

        # Run inference with bboxes prompt
        results = model("path/to/image.jpg", bboxes=[100, 100, 200, 200])

        # Run inference with single point
        results = model(points=[900, 370], labels=[1])

        # Run inference with multiple points

        results = predictor(source="test.mp4", points=[[[920, 470], [909, 138]]], labels=[[1, 0]])
        ```

- This example demonstrates how SAM 2 can be used to segment the entire content of an image or video if no prompts (bboxes/points/masks) are provided.

## SAM 2 comparison vs YOLOv8

Here we compare Meta's smallest SAM 2 model, SAM2-t, with Ultralytics smallest segmentation model, [YOLOv8n-seg](../tasks/segment.md):

| Model                                          | Size<br><sup>(MB)</sup> | Parameters<br><sup>(M)</sup> | Speed (CPU)<br><sup>(ms/im)</sup> |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| [Meta SAM-b](sam.md)                           | 375                     | 93.7                         | 161440                            |
| Meta SAM2-b                                    | 162                     | 80.8                         | 121923                            |
| Meta SAM2-t                                    | 78.1                    | 38.9                         | 85155                             |
| [MobileSAM](mobile-sam.md)                     | 40.7                    | 10.1                         | 98543                             |
| [FastSAM-s](fast-sam.md) with YOLOv8 backbone  | 23.7                    | 11.8                         | 140                               |
| Ultralytics [YOLOv8n-seg](../tasks/segment.md) | **6.7** (11.7x smaller) | **3.4** (11.4x less)         | **79.5** (1071x faster)           |

This comparison shows the order-of-magnitude differences in the model sizes and speeds between models. Whereas SAM presents unique capabilities for automatic segmenting, it is not a direct competitor to YOLOv8 segment models, which are smaller, faster and more efficient.

Tests run on a 2023 Apple M2 Macbook with 16GB of RAM using `torch==2.3.1` and `ultralytics==8.3.82`. To reproduce this test:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import ASSETS, SAM, YOLO, FastSAM

        # Profile SAM2-t, SAM2-b, SAM-b, MobileSAM
        for file in ["sam_b.pt", "sam2_b.pt", "sam2_t.pt", "mobile_sam.pt"]:
            model = SAM(file)
            model.info()
            model(ASSETS)

        # Profile FastSAM-s
        model = FastSAM("FastSAM-s.pt")
        model.info()
        model(ASSETS)

        # Profile YOLOv8n-seg
        model = YOLO("yolov8n-seg.pt")
        model.info()
        model(ASSETS)
        ```

## Limitations

Despite its strengths, SAM 2 has certain limitations:

- **Tracking Stability**: SAM 2 may lose track of objects during extended sequences or significant viewpoint changes.
- **Object Confusion**: The model can sometimes confuse similar-looking objects, particularly in crowded scenes.
- **Efficiency with Multiple Objects**: Segmentation efficiency decreases when processing multiple objects simultaneously due to the lack of inter-object communication.
- **Detail [Accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy)**: May miss fine details, especially with fast-moving objects. Additional prompts can partially address this issue, but temporal smoothness is not guaranteed.

This extensive dataset allows SAM 2 to achieve superior performance across major video segmentation benchmarks and enhances its zero-shot generalization capabilities. For more information, see the [SA-V Dataset](#sa-v-dataset) section.

### How does SAM 2 handle occlusions and object reappearances in video segmentation?

SAM 2 includes a sophisticated memory mechanism to manage temporal dependencies and occlusions in video data. The memory mechanism consists of:

- **Memory Encoder and Memory Bank**: Stores features from past frames.
- **Memory Attention Module**: Utilizes stored information to maintain consistent object tracking over time.
- **Occlusion Head**: Specifically handles scenarios where objects are not visible, predicting the likelihood of an object being occluded.

This mechanism ensures continuity even when objects are temporarily obscured or exit and re-enter the scene. For more details, refer to the [Memory Mechanism and Occlusion Handling](#memory-mechanism-and-occlusion-handling) section.

### How does SAM 2 compare to other segmentation models like YOLOv8?

SAM 2 and Ultralytics YOLOv8 serve different purposes and excel in different areas. While SAM 2 is designed for comprehensive object segmentation with advanced features like zero-shot generalization and real-time performance, YOLOv8 is optimized for speed and efficiency in [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) and segmentation tasks.

# Ultralytics COCO8-pose Dataset

Ultralytics COCO8-pose is a small, but versatile pose detection dataset composed of the first 8 images of the COCO train
2017 set, 4 for training and 4 for validation. This dataset is ideal for testing and debugging object detection models,
or for experimenting with new detection approaches. With 8 images, it is small enough to be easily manageable, yet
diverse enough to test training pipelines for errors and act as a sanity check before training larger datasets.

This dataset is intended for use with Ultralytics YOLOv8.

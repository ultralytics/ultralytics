# Security Policy

At [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com), the security of our users' data and systems is of utmost importance. To ensure the safety and security of our [open-source projects](https://github.com/ultralytics), we have implemented several measures to detect and prevent security vulnerabilities.

## Snyk Scanning

We use [Snyk](https://snyk.io/advisor/python/ultralytics) to regularly scan all Ultralytics repositories for vulnerabilities and security issues. Our goal is to identify and remediate any potential threats as soon as possible, to minimize any risks to our users.

## GitHub CodeQL Scanning

In addition to our Snyk scans, we also use GitHub's [CodeQL](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning-with-codeql) scans to proactively identify and address security vulnerabilities across all Ultralytics repositories.

[![CodeQL](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/actions/workflows/codeql.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/actions/workflows/codeql.yaml)

## Reporting Security Issues

If you suspect or discover a security vulnerability in any of our repositories, please let us know immediately. You can reach out to us directly via our [contact form](https://ultralytics.com/contact) or via [security@ultralytics.com](mailto:security@ultralytics.com). Our security team will investigate and respond as soon as possible.

We appreciate your help in keeping all Ultralytics open-source projects secure and safe for everyone.

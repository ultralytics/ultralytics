### Usage

Exporting YOLO11 models to ExecuTorch is straightforward:

!!! example "Usage"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load the YOLO11 model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Export the model to ExecuTorch format
        model.export(format="executorch")  # creates 'yolo11n_executorch_model' directory

        executorch_model = YOLO("yolo11n_executorch_model")

        results = executorch_model.predict("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Export a YOLO11n PyTorch model to ExecuTorch format
        yolo export model=yolo11n.pt format=executorch # creates 'yolo11n_executorch_model' directory

        # Run inference with the exported model
        yolo predict model=yolo11n_executorch_model source=https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg
        ```

### Export Arguments

When exporting to ExecuTorch format, you can specify the following arguments:

| Argument | Type            | Default | Description                                |
| -------- | --------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `imgsz`  | `int` or `list` | `640`   | Image size for model input (height, width) |
| `device` | `str`           | `'cpu'` | Device to use for export (`'cpu'`)         |

### Output Structure

The ExecuTorch export creates a directory containing the model and metadata:

```text
yolo11n_executorch_model/
├── yolo11n.pte              # ExecuTorch model file
└── metadata.yaml            # Model metadata (classes, image size, etc.)
```

## Using Exported ExecuTorch Models

After exporting your model, you'll need to integrate it into your target application using the ExecuTorch runtime.

### Mobile Integration

For mobile applications (iOS/Android), you'll need to:

1. **Add ExecuTorch Runtime**: Include the ExecuTorch runtime library in your mobile project
2. **Load Model**: Load the `.pte` file in your application
3. **Run Inference**: Process images and get predictions

Example iOS integration (Objective-C/C++):

```objc
// iOS uses C++ APIs for model loading and inference
// See https://pytorch.org/executorch/stable/using-executorch-ios.html for complete examples

#include <executorch/extension/module/module.h>

using namespace ::executorch::extension;

// Load the model
Module module("/path/to/yolo11n.pte");

// Create input tensor
float input[1 * 3 * 640 * 640];
auto tensor = from_blob(input, {1, 3, 640, 640});

// Run inference
const auto result = module.forward(tensor);
```

Example Android integration (Kotlin):

```kotlin
import org.pytorch.executorch.EValue
import org.pytorch.executorch.Module
import org.pytorch.executorch.Tensor

// Load the model
val module = Module.load("/path/to/yolo11n.pte")

// Prepare input tensor
val inputTensor = Tensor.fromBlob(floatData, longArrayOf(1, 3, 640, 640))
val inputEValue = EValue.from(inputTensor)

// Run inference
val outputs = module.forward(inputEValue)
val scores = outputs[0].toTensor().dataAsFloatArray
```

### Embedded Linux

For embedded Linux systems, use the ExecuTorch C++ API:

```cpp
#include <executorch/extension/module/module.h>

// Load model
auto module = torch::executor::Module("yolo11n.pte");

// Prepare input
std::vector<float> input_data = preprocessImage(image);
auto input_tensor = torch::executor::Tensor(input_data, {1, 3, 640, 640});

// Run inference
auto outputs = module.forward({input_tensor});
```

## Performance Optimization

### Model Size Optimization

To reduce model size for deployment:

- **Use Smaller Models**: Start with YOLO11n (nano) for the smallest footprint
- **Lower Input Resolution**: Use smaller image sizes (e.g., `imgsz=320` or `imgsz=416`)
- **Quantization**: Apply quantization techniques (supported in future ExecuTorch versions)

### Inference Speed Optimization

For faster inference:

- **XNNPACK Backend**: The default XNNPACK backend provides optimized CPU inference
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Use platform-specific delegates (e.g., CoreML for iOS)
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple images when possible

## Benchmarks

        blurrer = solutions.ObjectBlurrer(
            show=True,  # display the output
            model="yolo11n.pt",  # model for object blurring i.e. yolo11m.pt
            # line_width=2,  # width of bounding box.
            # classes=[0, 2],  # count specific classes i.e, person and car with COCO pretrained model.
            # blur_ratio=0.5,  # adjust percentage of blur intensity, the value in range 0.1 - 1.0
        )

        # Process video
        while cap.isOpened():
            success, im0 = cap.read()

            if not success:
                print("Video frame is empty or processing is complete.")
                break

            results = blurrer(im0)

            # print(results")  # access the output

            video_writer.write(results.plot_im)  # write the processed frame.

        cap.release()
        video_writer.release()
        cv2.destroyAllWindows()  # destroy all opened windows
        ```

## FAQ

### What is object blurring with Ultralytics YOLO11?

Object blurring with [Ultralytics YOLO11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/) involves automatically detecting and applying a blurring effect to specific objects in images or videos. This technique enhances privacy by concealing sensitive information while retaining relevant visual data. YOLO11's real-time processing capabilities make it suitable for applications requiring immediate privacy protection and selective focus adjustments.

### How can I implement real-time object blurring using YOLO11?

To implement real-time object blurring with YOLO11, follow the provided Python example. This involves using YOLO11 for [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) and OpenCV for applying the blur effect. Here's a simplified version:

```python
import cv2

from ultralytics import solutions

cap = cv2.VideoCapture("Path/to/video/file.mp4")
assert cap.isOpened(), "Error reading video file"
w, h, fps = (int(cap.get(x)) for x in (cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))

# Video writer
video_writer = cv2.VideoWriter("object_blurring_output.avi", cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"mp4v"), fps, (w, h))

# Init ObjectBlurrer
blurrer = solutions.ObjectBlurrer(
    show=True,  # display the output
    model="yolo11n.pt",  # model="yolo11n-obb.pt" for object blurring using YOLO11 OBB model.
    blur_ratio=0.5,  # set blur percentage i.e 0.7 for 70% blurred detected objects
    # line_width=2,  # width of bounding box.
    # classes=[0, 2],  # count specific classes i.e, person and car with COCO pretrained model.
)

# Process video
while cap.isOpened():
    success, im0 = cap.read()
    if not success:
        print("Video frame is empty or processing is complete.")
        break
    results = blurrer(im0)
    video_writer.write(results.plot_im)

cap.release()
video_writer.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### What are the benefits of using Ultralytics YOLO11 for object blurring?

Ultralytics YOLO11 offers several advantages for object blurring:

- **Privacy Protection**: Effectively obscure sensitive or identifiable information.
- **Selective Focus**: Target specific objects for blurring, maintaining essential visual content.
- **Real-time Processing**: Execute object blurring efficiently in dynamic environments, suitable for instant privacy enhancements.

### Can I use Ultralytics YOLO11 to blur faces in a video for privacy reasons?

Yes, Ultralytics YOLO11 can be configured to detect and blur faces in videos to protect privacy. By training or using a pre-trained model to specifically recognize faces, the detection results can be processed with [OpenCV](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/opencv) to apply a blur effect. Refer to our guide on [object detection with YOLO11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) and modify the code to target face detection.

### How does YOLO11 compare to other object detection models like Faster R-CNN for object blurring?

Ultralytics YOLO11 typically outperforms models like Faster R-CNN in terms of speed, making it more suitable for real-time applications. While both models offer accurate detection, YOLO11's architecture is optimized for rapid inference, which is critical for tasks like real-time object blurring.

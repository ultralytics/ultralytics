# ByteTrack tracker defaults for mode="track"
# Docs: https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/track/

tracker_type: bytetrack # (str) Tracker backend: botsort|bytetrack; choose bytetrack for the classic baseline
track_high_thresh: 0.25 # (float) First-stage match threshold; raise for cleaner tracks, lower to keep more
track_low_thresh: 0.1 # (float) Second-stage threshold for low-score matches; balances recovery vs drift
new_track_thresh: 0.25 # (float) Start a new track if no match â‰¥ this; higher reduces false tracks
track_buffer: 30 # (int) Frames to keep lost tracks alive; higher handles occlusion, increases ID switches risk
match_thresh: 0.8 # (float) Association similarity threshold (IoU/cost); tune with detector quality
fuse_score: True # (bool) Fuse detection score with motion/IoU for matching; stabilizes weak detections

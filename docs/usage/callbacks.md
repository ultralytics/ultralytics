## Callbacks

Ultralytics framework supports callbacks as entry points in strategic stages of train, val, export, and predict modes. Each callback accepts a `Trainer`, `Validator`, or `Predictor` object depending on the operation type. All properties of these objects can be found in Reference section of the docs.

## Examples

### Returning additional information with Prediction

In this example, we want to return the original frame with each result object. Here's how we can do that

```python
def on_predict_batch_end(predictor):
    # Retrieve the batch data
    _, im0s, _, _ = predictor.batch

    # Ensure that im0s is a list
    im0s = im0s if isinstance(im0s, list) else [im0s]

    # Combine the prediction results with the corresponding frames
    predictor.results = zip(predictor.results, im0s)


# Create a YOLO model instance
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

# Add the custom callback to the model
model.add_callback("on_predict_batch_end", on_predict_batch_end)

# Iterate through the results and frames
for result, frame in model.track / predict():
    pass
```

## All callbacks

Here are all supported callbacks. See callbacks [source code](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/utils/callbacks/base.py) for additional details.

# Ultralytics HUB Datasets

[Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) datasets are a practical solution for managing and leveraging your custom datasets.

Once uploaded, datasets can be immediately utilized for model training. This integrated approach facilitates a seamless transition from dataset management to model training, significantly simplifying the entire process.

## Upload Dataset

[Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) datasets are just like YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 ðŸš€ datasets. They use the same structure and the same label formats to keep everything simple.

Before you upload a dataset to [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub), make sure to **place your dataset YAML file inside the dataset root directory** and that **your dataset YAML, directory and ZIP have the same name**, as shown in the example below, and then zip the dataset directory.

For example, if your dataset is called "coco8", as our [COCO8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco8/) example dataset, then you should have a `coco8.yaml` inside your `coco8/` directory, which will create a `coco8.zip` when zipped:

```bash
zip -r coco8.zip coco8
```

You can download our [COCO8](https://github.com/ultralytics/hub/blob/main/example_datasets/coco8.zip) example dataset and unzip it to see exactly how to structure your dataset.

<p align="center">
  <img  src="https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/coco8-dataset-structure.avif" alt="COCO8 Dataset Structure" width="80%">
</p>

The dataset YAML is the same standard YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 YAML format.

!!! example "coco8.yaml"

    ```yaml
    --8<-- "ultralytics/cfg/datasets/coco8.yaml"
    ```

After zipping your dataset, you should [validate it](https://docs.ultralytics.com/reference/hub/__init__/#ultralytics.hub.check_dataset) before uploading it to [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub). [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) conducts the dataset validation check post-upload, so by ensuring your dataset is correctly formatted and error-free ahead of time, you can forestall any setbacks due to dataset rejection.

```python
from ultralytics.hub import check_dataset

check_dataset("path/to/dataset.zip", task="detect")
```

Once your dataset ZIP is ready, navigate to the [Datasets](https://hub.ultralytics.com/datasets) page by clicking on the **Datasets** button in the sidebar and click on the **Upload Dataset** button on the top right of the page.

??? tip

    You can upload a dataset directly from the [Home](https://hub.ultralytics.com/home) page.

    ![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Home page with an arrow pointing to the Upload Dataset card](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/ultralytics-hub-upload-dataset-card.avif)

This action will trigger the **Upload Dataset** dialog.

Select the dataset task of your dataset and upload it in the _Dataset .zip file_ field.

You have the additional option to set a custom name and description for your [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) dataset.

When you're happy with your dataset configuration, click **Upload**.

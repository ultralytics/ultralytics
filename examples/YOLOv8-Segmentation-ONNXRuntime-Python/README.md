# YOLOv8-Segmentation-ONNXRuntime-Python Demo

This repository provides a Python demo for performing segmentation with YOLOv8 using ONNX Runtime, highlighting the interoperability of YOLOv8 models without the need for the full PyTorch stack.

## Features

- **Framework Agnostic**: Runs segmentation inference purely on ONNX Runtime without importing PyTorch.
- **Efficient Inference**: Supports both FP32 and FP16 precision for ONNX models, catering to different computational needs.
- **Ease of Use**: Utilizes simple command-line arguments for model execution.
- **Broad Compatibility**: Leverages Numpy and OpenCV for image processing, ensuring broad compatibility with various environments.

## Installation

Install the required packages using pip. You will need `ultralytics` for exporting YOLOv8-seg ONNX model and using some utility functions, `onnxruntime-gpu` for GPU-accelerated inference, and `opencv-python` for image processing.

```bash
pip install ultralytics
pip install onnxruntime-gpu # For GPU support
# pip install onnxruntime # For CPU-only support
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Export the YOLOv8 ONNX Model

Export the YOLOv8 segmentation model to ONNX format using the provided `ultralytics` package.

```bash
yolo export model=yolov8s-seg.pt imgsz=640 format=onnx opset=12 simplify
```

### 2. Run Inference

Perform inference with the exported ONNX model on your images.

```bash
python main.py --model MODEL_PATH --source IMAGE_PATH
```

### Example Output

After running the command, you should see segmentation results similar to this:

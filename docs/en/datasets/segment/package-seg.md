## Dataset Structure

The distribution of data in the Package Segmentation Dataset is structured as follows:

- **Training set**: Encompasses 1920 images accompanied by their corresponding annotations.
- **Testing set**: Consists of 89 images, each paired with its respective annotations.
- **Validation set**: Comprises 188 images, each with corresponding annotations.

## Applications

Package segmentation, facilitated by the Package Segmentation Dataset, is crucial for optimizing logistics, enhancing last-mile delivery, improving manufacturing quality control, and contributing to smart city solutions. From e-commerce to security applications, this dataset is a key resource, fostering innovation in computer vision for diverse and efficient package analysis applications.

### Smart Warehouses and Logistics

In modern warehouses, [vision AI solutions](https://www.ultralytics.com/solutions) can streamline operations by automating package identification and sorting. Computer vision models trained on this dataset can quickly detect and segment packages in real-time, even in challenging environments with dim lighting or cluttered spaces. This leads to faster processing times, reduced errors, and improved overall efficiency in [logistics operations](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/ultralytics-yolo11-the-key-to-computer-vision-in-logistics).

### Quality Control and Damage Detection

Package segmentation models can be used to identify damaged packages by analyzing their shape and appearance. By detecting irregularities or deformations in package outlines, these models help ensure that only intact packages proceed through the supply chain, reducing customer complaints and return rates. This is a key aspect of [quality control in manufacturing](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/improving-manufacturing-with-computer-vision) and is vital for maintaining product integrity.

## Dataset YAML

A YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) file defines the dataset configuration, including paths, classes, and other essential details. For the Package Segmentation dataset, the `package-seg.yaml` file is maintained at [https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/package-seg.yaml](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/package-seg.yaml).

### ‚úçÔ∏è Google-Style Docstrings

When adding new functions or classes, please include [Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). These docstrings provide clear, standardized documentation that helps other developers understand and maintain your code.

!!! example "Example Docstrings"

    === "Google-style"

        This example illustrates a Google-style docstring. Ensure that both input and output `types` are always enclosed in parentheses, e.g., `(bool)`.

        ```python
        def example_function(arg1, arg2=4):
            """
            Example function demonstrating Google-style docstrings.

            Args:
                arg1 (int): The first argument.
                arg2 (int): The second argument, with a default value of 4.

            Returns:
                (bool): True if successful, False otherwise.

            Examples:
                >>> result = example_function(1, 2)  # returns False
            """
            if arg1 == arg2:
                return True
            return False
        ```

    === "Google-style with type hints"

        This example includes both a Google-style docstring and [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) for arguments and returns, though using either independently is also acceptable.

        ```python
        def example_function(arg1: int, arg2: int = 4) -> bool:
            """
            Example function demonstrating Google-style docstrings.

            Args:
                arg1: The first argument.
                arg2: The second argument, with a default value of 4.

            Returns:
                True if successful, False otherwise.

            Examples:
                >>> result = example_function(1, 2)  # returns False
            """
            if arg1 == arg2:
                return True
            return False
        ```

    === "Single-line"

        For smaller or simpler functions, a single-line docstring may be sufficient. The docstring must use three double-quotes, be a complete sentence, start with a capital letter, and end with a period.

        ```python
        def example_small_function(arg1: int, arg2: int = 4) -> bool:
            """Example function with a single-line docstring."""
            return arg1 == arg2
        ```

### ‚úÖ GitHub Actions CI Tests

All pull requests must pass the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) [Continuous Integration](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/CI/) (CI) tests before they can be merged. These tests include linting, unit tests, and other checks to ensure that your changes meet the project's quality standards. Review the CI output and address any issues that arise.

## ‚ú® Best Practices for Code Contributions

When contributing code to Ultralytics projects, keep these best practices in mind:

- **Avoid code duplication:** Reuse existing code wherever possible and minimize unnecessary arguments.
- **Make smaller, focused changes:** Focus on targeted modifications rather than large-scale changes.
- **Simplify when possible:** Look for opportunities to simplify the code or remove unnecessary parts.
- **Consider compatibility:** Before making changes, consider whether they might break existing code using Ultralytics.
- **Use consistent formatting:** Tools like [Ruff Formatter](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) can help maintain stylistic consistency.
- **Add appropriate tests:** Include [tests](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/model-testing/) for new features to ensure they work as expected.

## üëÄ Reviewing Pull Requests

Reviewing pull requests is another valuable way to contribute. When reviewing PRs:

- **Check for unit tests:** Verify that the PR includes tests for new features or changes.
- **Review documentation updates:** Ensure [documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) is updated to reflect changes.
- **Evaluate performance impact:** Consider how changes might affect [performance](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/yolo-performance-metrics/).
- **Verify CI tests:** Confirm all [Continuous Integration tests](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/CI/) are passing.
- **Provide constructive feedback:** Offer specific, clear feedback about any issues or concerns.
- **Recognize effort:** Acknowledge the author's work to maintain a positive collaborative atmosphere.

## üêû Reporting Bugs

We highly value bug reports as they help us improve the quality and reliability of our projects. When reporting a bug via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/issues):

- **Check existing issues:** Search first to see if the bug has already been reported.
- **Provide a [Minimum Reproducible Example](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/minimum-reproducible-example/):** Create a small, self-contained code snippet that consistently reproduces the issue. This is crucial for efficient debugging.
- **Describe the environment:** Specify your operating system, Python version, relevant library versions (e.g., [`torch`](https://pytorch.org/), [`ultralytics`](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)), and hardware ([CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)/[GPU](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/gpu-graphics-processing-unit)).
- **Explain expected vs. actual behavior:** Clearly state what you expected to happen and what actually occurred. Include any error messages or tracebacks.

# Ultralytics HUB Integrations

Learn about [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) integrations with various platforms and formats to streamline your [AI](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/artificial-intelligence-ai) workflows.

## Datasets

Seamlessly import your datasets into Ultralytics HUB for efficient [model training](../modes/train.md).

Once a dataset is imported, you can [train a model](./models.md#train-model) on it just as you would with native Ultralytics HUB datasets.

### Roboflow

You can easily filter Roboflow datasets on the Ultralytics HUB **Datasets** page.

Ultralytics HUB supports two types of integrations with Roboflow: **Universe** and **Workspace**.

#### Universe

The Roboflow Universe integration allows you to import one [dataset](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/benchmark-dataset) at a time into Ultralytics HUB from Roboflow.

##### Import

When exporting a Roboflow dataset, select the Ultralytics HUB format. This action redirects you to Ultralytics HUB and opens the **Dataset Import** dialog.

Import your Roboflow dataset by clicking the **Import** button.

Next, you can train a model on your newly imported dataset.

##### Remove

Navigate to the Dataset page of the Roboflow dataset you wish to remove. Open the dataset actions dropdown menu and click the **Remove** option.

??? tip

    You can also remove an imported Roboflow dataset directly from the main **Datasets** page.

#### Workspace

The Roboflow Workspace integration allows you to import an entire Roboflow Workspace at once into Ultralytics HUB.

##### Import

Navigate to the **Integrations** page by clicking the **Integrations** button in the sidebar.

Enter your Roboflow Workspace private [API key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_key) and click the **Add** button.

??? tip

    Clicking the **Get my API key** button will redirect you to your Roboflow Workspace settings, where you can find your private API key.

This connects your Ultralytics HUB account with your Roboflow Workspace, making your Roboflow datasets available within Ultralytics HUB.

![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Integrations page with an arrow pointing to one of the connected workspaces](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/hub-roboflow-workspace-import-2.avif)

Next, you can train a model using any of the datasets from the connected workspace.

##### Remove

Navigate to the **Integrations** page via the sidebar. Click the **Unlink** button for the Roboflow Workspace you want to disconnect.

![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Integrations page  with an arrow pointing to the Integrations button in the sidebar and one to the Unlink button of one of the connected workspaces](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/hub-roboflow-workspace-remove-1.avif)

??? tip

    You can also unlink a connected Roboflow Workspace directly from the Dataset page of any dataset belonging to that workspace.

    ![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Dataset page of a Roboflow Workspace dataset with an arrow pointing to the remove option](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/hub-roboflow-workspace-remove-2.avif)

??? tip

    Alternatively, remove a connected Roboflow Workspace directly from the main **Datasets** page using the remove option associated with any dataset from that workspace.

## Models

### Exports

After you train a model, you can [export it](./models.md#deploy-model) to 13 different formats using the [Export mode](../modes/export.md), including popular ones like [ONNX](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/onnx-open-neural-network-exchange), [OpenVINO](../integrations/openvino.md), [CoreML](../integrations/coreml.md), [TensorFlow](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/tensorflow), and [PaddlePaddle](../integrations/paddlepaddle.md).

![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Deploy tab inside the Model page with an arrow pointing to the Export card and all formats exported](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/ultralytics-hub-deploy-export-formats.avif)

The available export formats are detailed in the table below.

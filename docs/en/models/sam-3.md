# SAM 3: Segment Anything with Concepts

!!! note "Coming Soon ‚ö†Ô∏è"

    üöß SAM 3 models have not yet been publicly released by Meta. The information below is based on the research paper submitted to ICLR 2026.
    Model downloads and final benchmarks will be available following Meta's official release.

![SAM 3 Overview](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/sam-3-overview.webp)

**SAM 3** (Segment Anything Model 3) represents Meta's next-generation foundation model for **Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS)**. Building upon [SAM 2](sam-2.md), SAM 3 introduces a fundamentally new capability: detecting, segmenting, and tracking **all instances** of a visual concept specified by text prompts, image exemplars, or both. Unlike previous SAM versions that segment single objects per prompt, SAM 3 can find and segment every occurrence of a concept appearing anywhere in images or videos, aligning with open-vocabulary goals in modern [instance segmentation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/instance-segmentation).

## Overview

SAM 3 achieves a **2√ó performance gain** over existing systems in Promptable Concept Segmentation while maintaining and improving SAM 2's capabilities for interactive [visual segmentation](../tasks/segment.md). The model excels at open-vocabulary segmentation, allowing users to specify concepts using simple noun phrases (e.g., "yellow school bus", "striped cat") or by providing example images of the target object. These capabilities complement production-ready pipelines that rely on streamlined [predict](../modes/predict.md) and [track](../modes/track.md) workflows.

![SAM 3 Segmentation](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/sam-3-segmentation.webp)

### What is Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS)?

The PCS task takes a **concept prompt** as input and returns segmentation masks with unique identities for **all matching object instances**. Concept prompts can be:

- **Text**: Simple noun phrases like "red apple" or "person wearing a hat", similar to [zero-shot learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/zero-shot-learning)
- **Image exemplars**: Bounding boxes around example objects (positive or negative) for fast generalization
- **Combined**: Both text and image exemplars together for precise control

This differs from traditional visual prompts (points, boxes, masks) which segment only a single specific object instance, as popularized by the original [SAM family](../models/sam.md).

### Key Performance Metrics

| Metric                         | SAM 3 Achievement                                        |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LVIS Zero-Shot Mask AP**     | **47.0** (vs previous best 38.5, +22% improvement)       |
| **SA-Co Benchmark**            | **2√ó better** than existing systems                      |
| **Inference Speed (H200 GPU)** | **30 ms** per image with 100+ detected objects           |
| **Video Performance**          | Near real-time for ~5 concurrent objects                 |
| **MOSEv2 VOS Benchmark**       | **60.1 J&F** (+25.5% over SAM 2.1, +17% over prior SOTA) |
| **Interactive Refinement**     | **+18.6 CGF1** improvement after 3 exemplar prompts      |
| **Human Performance Gap**      | Achieves **88%** of estimated lower bound on SA-Co/Gold  |

## Architecture

SAM 3 consists of a **detector** and **tracker** that share a Perception Encoder (PE) vision backbone. This decoupled design avoids task conflicts while enabling both image-level detection and video-level tracking, with an interface compatible with Ultralytics [Python usage](../usage/python.md) and [CLI usage](../usage/cli.md).

### Core Components

- **Detector**: [DETR-based architecture](rtdetr.md) for image-level concept detection
    - Text encoder for noun phrase prompts
    - Exemplar encoder for image-based prompts
    - Fusion encoder to condition image features on prompts
    - Novel **presence head** that decouples recognition ("what") from localization ("where")
    - Mask head for generating instance segmentation masks

- **Tracker**: Memory-based video segmentation inherited from [SAM 2](sam-2.md)
    - Prompt encoder, mask decoder, memory encoder
    - Memory bank for storing object appearance across frames
    - Temporal disambiguation aided by techniques like a [Kalman filter](../reference/trackers/utils/kalman_filter.md) in multi-object settings

- **Presence Token**: A learned global token that predicts whether the target concept is present in the image/frame, improving detection by separating recognition from localization.

![SAM 3 Architecture](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/sam-3-architecture.webp)

### Key Innovations

1. **Decoupled Recognition and Localization**: The presence head predicts concept presence globally, while proposal queries focus only on localization, avoiding conflicting objectives.
2. **Unified Concept and Visual Prompts**: Supports both PCS (concept prompts) and PVS (visual prompts like SAM 2's clicks/boxes) in a single model.
3. **Interactive Exemplar Refinement**: Users can add positive or negative image exemplars to iteratively refine results, with the model generalizing to similar objects rather than just correcting individual instances.
4. **Temporal Disambiguation**: Uses masklet detection scores and periodic re-prompting to handle occlusions, crowded scenes, and tracking failures in video, aligning with [instance segmentation and tracking](../guides/instance-segmentation-and-tracking.md) best practices.

## SA-Co Dataset

SAM 3 is trained on **Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co)**, Meta's largest and most diverse segmentation dataset to date, expanding beyond common benchmarks like [COCO](../datasets/detect/coco.md) and [LVIS](../datasets/detect/lvis.md).

### Training Data

| Dataset Component | Description                                                      | Scale                                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **SA-Co/HQ**      | High-quality human-annotated image data from 4-phase data engine | 5.2M images, 4M unique noun phrases     |
| **SA-Co/SYN**     | Synthetic dataset labeled by AI without human involvement        | 38M noun phrases, 1.4B masks            |
| **SA-Co/EXT**     | 15 external datasets enriched with hard negatives                | Varies by source                        |
| **SA-Co/VIDEO**   | Video annotations with temporal tracking                         | 52.5K videos, 24.8K unique noun phrases |

### Benchmark Data

The **SA-Co evaluation benchmark** contains **214K unique phrases** across **126K images and videos**, providing over **50√ó more concepts** than existing benchmarks. It includes:

- **SA-Co/Gold**: 7 domains, triple-annotated for measuring human performance bounds
- **SA-Co/Silver**: 10 domains, single human annotation
- **SA-Co/Bronze** and **SA-Co/Bio**: 9 existing datasets adapted for concept segmentation
- **SA-Co/VEval**: Video benchmark with 3 domains (SA-V, YT-Temporal-1B, SmartGlasses)

### Data Engine Innovations

SAM 3's scalable human- and model-in-the-loop data engine achieves **2√ó annotation throughput** through:

1. **AI Annotators**: [Llama](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971) based models propose diverse noun phrases including hard negatives
2. **AI Verifiers**: Fine-tuned [multimodal LLMs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs) verify mask quality and exhaustivity at near-human performance
3. **Active Mining**: Focuses human effort on challenging failure cases where AI struggles
4. **Ontology-Driven**: Leverages a large ontology grounded in [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) for concept coverage

## Installation

SAM 3 will be supported natively in the Ultralytics package upon release:

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

Models will download automatically when first used. You can then use standard [predict mode](../modes/predict.md) and later [export](../modes/export.md) models to formats like [ONNX](../integrations/onnx.md) and [TensorRT](../integrations/tensorrt.md) for deployment.

## How to Use SAM 3: Versatility in Concept Segmentation

| **RF100-VL** | 14.3      | **35.7**   | 33.7 (gDino-T)          |

### Interactive Refinement Effectiveness

SAM 3's concept-based prompting with exemplars converges much faster than visual prompting:

| Prompts Added | CGF1 Score | Gain vs Text-Only | Gain vs PVS Baseline |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Text only     | 46.4       | baseline          | baseline             |
| +1 exemplar   | 57.6       | +11.2             | +6.7                 |
| +2 exemplars  | 62.2       | +15.8             | +9.7                 |
| +3 exemplars  | **65.0**   | **+18.6**         | **+11.2**            |
| +4 exemplars  | 65.7       | +19.3             | +11.5 (plateau)      |

### Object Counting Accuracy

SAM 3 provides accurate counting by segmenting all instances, a common requirement in [object counting](../guides/object-counting.md):

| Benchmark       | Accuracy  | MAE  | vs Best MLLM       |
| --------------- | --------- | ---- | ------------------ |
| **CountBench**  | **95.6%** | 0.11 | 92.4% (Gemini 2.5) |
| **PixMo-Count** | **87.3%** | 0.22 | 88.8% (Molmo-72B)  |

## SAM 3 vs SAM 2 vs YOLO Comparison

Here we compare SAM 3's capabilities with SAM 2 and [YOLO11](../models/yolo11.md) models:

| Capability                   | SAM 3                                 | SAM 2                | YOLO11n-seg        |

**Key Takeaways**:

- **SAM 3**: Best for open-vocabulary concept segmentation, finding all instances of a concept with text or exemplar prompts
- **SAM 2**: Best for interactive single-object segmentation in images and videos with geometric prompts
- **YOLO11**: Best for real-time, high-speed segmentation in resource-constrained deployments using efficient [export pipelines](../modes/export.md) like [ONNX](../integrations/onnx.md) and [TensorRT](../integrations/tensorrt.md)

## Evaluation Metrics

SAM 3 introduces new metrics designed for the PCS task, complementing familiar measures like [F1 score](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/f1-score), [precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/precision), and [recall](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/recall).

### Classification-Gated F1 (CGF1)

The primary metric combining localization and classification:

**CGF1 = 100 √ó pmF1 √ó IL_MCC**

Where:

- **pmF1** (Positive Macro F1): Measures localization quality on positive examples
- **IL_MCC** (Image-Level Matthews Correlation Coefficient): Measures binary classification accuracy ("is the concept present?")

### Why These Metrics?

Traditional AP metrics don't account for calibration, making models difficult to use in practice. By evaluating only predictions above 0.5 confidence, SAM 3's metrics enforce good calibration and mimic real-world usage patterns in interactive [predict](../modes/predict.md) and [track](../modes/track.md) loops.

## Key Ablations and Insights

### Impact of Presence Head

The presence head decouples recognition from localization, providing significant improvements:

| Configuration     | CGF1     | IL_MCC   | pmF1     |
| ----------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Without presence  | 57.6     | 0.77     | 74.7     |
| **With presence** | **63.3** | **0.82** | **77.1** |

The presence head provides a **+5.7 CGF1 boost** (+9.9%), primarily improving recognition ability (IL_MCC +6.5%).

### Effect of Hard Negatives

| Hard Negatives/Image | CGF1     | IL_MCC   | pmF1     |
| -------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0                    | 31.8     | 0.44     | 70.2     |
| 5                    | 44.8     | 0.62     | 71.9     |
| **30**               | **49.2** | **0.68** | **72.3** |

Hard negatives are crucial for open-vocabulary recognition, improving IL_MCC by **54.5%** (0.44 ‚Üí 0.68).

### Training Data Scaling

| Data Sources         | CGF1     | IL_MCC   | pmF1     |
| -------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| External only        | 30.9     | 0.46     | 66.3     |
| External + Synthetic | 39.7     | 0.57     | 70.6     |
| External + HQ        | 51.8     | 0.71     | 73.2     |
| **All three**        | **54.3** | **0.74** | **73.5** |

High-quality human annotations provide large gains over synthetic or external data alone. For background on data quality practices, see [data collection and annotation](../guides/data-collection-and-annotation.md).

## Applications

SAM 3's concept segmentation capability enables new use cases:

- **Content Moderation**: Find all instances of specific content types across media libraries
- **E-commerce**: Segment all products of a certain type in catalog images, supporting [auto-annotation](../guides/preprocessing_annotated_data.md)
- **Medical Imaging**: Identify all occurrences of specific tissue types or abnormalities
- **Autonomous Systems**: Track all instances of traffic signs, pedestrians, or vehicles by category
- **Video Analytics**: Count and track all people wearing specific clothing or performing actions
- **Dataset Annotation**: Rapidly annotate all instances of rare object categories
- **Scientific Research**: Quantify and analyze all specimens matching specific criteria

## SAM 3 Agent: Extended Language Reasoning

SAM 3 can be combined with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to handle complex queries requiring reasoning, similar in spirit to open-vocabulary systems like [OWLv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09683) and [T-Rex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03533).

### Performance on Reasoning Tasks

| Benchmark                  | Metric | SAM 3 Agent (Gemini 2.5 Pro) | Previous Best |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| **ReasonSeg (validation)** | gIoU   | **76.0**                     | 65.0 (SoTA)   |
| **ReasonSeg (test)**       | gIoU   | **73.8**                     | 61.3 (SoTA)   |
| **OmniLabel (validation)** | AP     | **46.7**                     | 36.5 (REAL)   |
| **RefCOCO+**               | Acc    | **91.2**                     | 89.3 (LISA)   |

### Example Complex Queries

SAM 3 Agent can handle queries requiring reasoning:

- "People sitting down but not holding a gift box in their hands"
- "The dog closest to the camera that is not wearing a collar"
- "Red objects larger than the person's hand"

The MLLM proposes simple noun phrase queries to SAM 3, analyzes returned masks, and iterates until satisfied.

## Limitations

While SAM 3 represents a major advancement, it has certain limitations:

- **Phrase Complexity**: Best suited for simple noun phrases; long referring expressions or complex reasoning may require MLLM integration
- **Ambiguity Handling**: Some concepts remain inherently ambiguous (e.g., "small window", "cozy room")
- **Computational Requirements**: Larger and slower than specialized detection models like [YOLO](../models/yolo26.md)
- **Vocabulary Scope**: Focused on atomic visual concepts; compositional reasoning is limited without MLLM assistance
- **Rare Concepts**: Performance may degrade on extremely rare or fine-grained concepts not well-represented in training data

## FAQ

### When Will SAM 3 Be Released?

SAM 3 is currently under review at ICLR 2026 (conference in 2026, review in 2025). Official models, weights, and benchmarks will be released publicly following the review process, likely in 2026. Ultralytics will provide immediate support for SAM 3 integration upon Meta's release and document usage in [predict mode](../modes/predict.md) and [track mode](../modes/track.md).

### Will SAM 3 Be Integrated Into Ultralytics?

Yes. SAM 3 will be supported in the Ultralytics Python package upon release, including concept segmentation, SAM 2‚Äìstyle visual prompts, and multi-object video tracking. You will be able to [export](../modes/export.md) to formats like [ONNX](../integrations/onnx.md) and [TensorRT](../integrations/tensorrt.md) for deployment, with streamlined [Python](../usage/python.md) and [CLI](../usage/cli.md) workflows.

!!! warning "Implementation Timeline"

    Code examples in this documentation are preview versions showing intended usage patterns. Actual implementation will be available after Meta releases SAM 3 weights and Ultralytics completes integration.

### What Is Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS)?

PCS is a new task introduced in SAM 3 that segments **all instances** of a visual concept in an image or video. Unlike traditional segmentation that targets a specific object instance, PCS finds every occurrence of a category. For example:

- **Text prompt**: "yellow school bus" ‚Üí segments all yellow school buses in the scene
- **Image exemplar**: Box around one dog ‚Üí segments all dogs in the image
- **Combined**: "striped cat" + exemplar box ‚Üí segments all striped cats matching the example

See related background on [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) and [instance segmentation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/instance-segmentation).

### How Does SAM 3 Differ From SAM 2?

| Feature                    | SAM 2                         | SAM 3                                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Task**                   | Single object per prompt      | All instances of a concept            |
| **Prompt Types**           | Points, boxes, masks          | + Text phrases, image exemplars       |
| **Detection Capability**   | Requires external detector    | Built-in open-vocabulary detector     |
| **Recognition**            | Geometry-based only           | Text and visual recognition           |
| **Architecture**           | Tracker only                  | Detector + Tracker with presence head |
| **Zero-Shot Performance**  | N/A (requires visual prompts) | 47.0 AP on LVIS, 2√ó better on SA-Co   |
| **Interactive Refinement** | Clicks only                   | Clicks + exemplar generalization      |

SAM 3 maintains backward compatibility with [SAM 2](sam-2.md) visual prompting while adding concept-based capabilities.

### What datasets are used to train SAM 3?

SAM 3 is trained on the **Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co)** dataset:

**Training Data**:

- **5.2M images** with **4M unique noun phrases** (SA-Co/HQ) - high-quality human annotations
- **52.5K videos** with **24.8K unique noun phrases** (SA-Co/VIDEO)
- **1.4B synthetic masks** across **38M noun phrases** (SA-Co/SYN)
- **15 external datasets** enriched with hard negatives (SA-Co/EXT)

**Benchmark Data**:

- **214K unique concepts** across **126K images/videos**
- **50√ó more concepts** than existing benchmarks (e.g., LVIS has ~4K concepts)
- Triple annotation on SA-Co/Gold for measuring human performance bounds

This massive scale and diversity enables SAM 3's superior zero-shot generalization across open-vocabulary concepts.

### How does SAM 3 compare to YOLO11 for segmentation?

SAM 3 and YOLO11 serve different use cases:

**SAM 3 Advantages**:

- **Open-vocabulary**: Segments any concept via text prompts without training
- **Zero-shot**: Works on new categories immediately
- **Interactive**: Exemplar-based refinement generalizes to similar objects
- **Concept-based**: Automatically finds all instances of a category
- **Accuracy**: 47.0 AP on LVIS zero-shot instance segmentation

**YOLO11 Advantages**:

- **Speed**: 10-15√ó faster inference (2-3ms vs 30ms per image)
- **Efficiency**: 70√ó smaller models (5.9MB vs ~400MB expected)
- **Resource-friendly**: Runs on edge devices and mobile
- **Real-time**: Optimized for production deployments

**Recommendation**:

- Use **SAM 3** for flexible, open-vocabulary segmentation where you need to find all instances of concepts described by text or examples
- Use **YOLO11** for high-speed, production deployments where categories are known in advance
- Use **SAM 2** for interactive single-object segmentation with geometric prompts

### Can SAM 3 handle complex language queries?

SAM 3 is designed for simple noun phrases (e.g., "red apple", "person wearing hat"). For complex queries requiring reasoning, combine SAM 3 with an MLLM as **SAM 3 Agent**:

**Simple queries (native SAM 3)**:

- "yellow school bus"
- "striped cat"
- "person wearing red hat"

**Complex queries (SAM 3 Agent with MLLM)**:

- "People sitting down but not holding a gift box"
- "The dog closest to the camera without a collar"
- "Red objects larger than the person's hand"

SAM 3 Agent achieves **76.0 gIoU** on ReasonSeg validation (vs 65.0 previous best, +16.9% improvement) by combining SAM 3's segmentation with MLLM reasoning capabilities.

### How accurate is SAM 3 compared to human performance?

On the SA-Co/Gold benchmark with triple human annotation:

- **Human lower bound**: 74.2 CGF1 (most conservative annotator)
- **SAM 3 performance**: 65.0 CGF1
- **Achievement**: **88%** of estimated human lower bound
- **Human upper bound**: 81.4 CGF1 (most liberal annotator)

SAM 3 achieves strong performance approaching human-level accuracy on open-vocabulary concept segmentation, with the gap primarily on ambiguous or subjective concepts (e.g., "small window", "cozy room").

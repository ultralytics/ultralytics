---

YOLO settings and hyperparameters play a critical role in the model's performance, speed, and accuracy. These settings and hyperparameters can affect the model's behavior at various stages of the model development process, including training, validation, and prediction.

YOLOv8 `yolo` CLI commands use the following syntax:

!!! example ""

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo TASK MODE ARGS
        ```

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a YOLOv8 model from a pre-trained weights file
        model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

        # Run MODE mode using the custom arguments ARGS (guess TASK)
        model.MODE(ARGS)
        ```

Where:

- `TASK` (optional) is one of `[detect, segment, classify, pose]`. If it is not passed explicitly YOLOv8 will try to guess the `TASK` from the model type.
- `MODE` (required) is one of `[train, val, predict, export, track, benchmark]`
- `ARGS` (optional) are any number of custom `arg=value` pairs like `imgsz=320` that override defaults.

For a full list of available `ARGS` see the [Configuration](cfg.md) page and `defaults.yaml` GitHub [source](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/default.yaml).

#### Tasks

YOLO models can be used for a variety of tasks, including detection, segmentation, classification and pose. These tasks differ in the type of output they produce and the specific problem they are designed to solve.

**Detect**: For identifying and localizing objects or regions of interest in an image or video.
**Segment**: For dividing an image or video into regions or pixels that correspond to different objects or classes.
**Classify**: For predicting the class label of an input image.
**Pose**: For identifying objects and estimating their keypoints in an image or video.

| ------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `task` | `'detect'` | YOLO task, i.e. detect, segment, classify, pose |

#### Modes

YOLO models can be used in different modes depending on the specific problem you are trying to solve. These modes include:

**Train**: For training a YOLOv8 model on a custom dataset.
**Val**: For validating a YOLOv8 model after it has been trained.
**Predict**: For making predictions using a trained YOLOv8 model on new images or videos.
**Export**: For exporting a YOLOv8 model to a format that can be used for deployment.
**Track**: For tracking objects in real-time using a YOLOv8 model.
**Benchmark**: For benchmarking YOLOv8 exports (ONNX, TensorRT, etc.) speed and accuracy.

## Train

The training settings for YOLO models encompass various hyperparameters and configurations used during the training process. These settings influence the model's performance, speed, and accuracy. Key training settings include batch size, learning rate, momentum, and weight decay. Additionally, the choice of optimizer, loss function, and training dataset composition can impact the training process. Careful tuning and experimentation with these settings are crucial for optimizing performance.

## Predict

The prediction settings for YOLO models encompass a range of hyperparameters and configurations that influence the model's performance, speed, and accuracy during inference on new data. Careful tuning and experimentation with these settings are essential to achieve optimal performance for a specific task. Key settings include the confidence threshold, Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) threshold, and the number of classes considered. Additional factors affecting the prediction process are input data size and format, the presence of supplementary features such as masks or multiple labels per box, and the particular task the model is employed for.

Export settings for YOLO models encompass configurations and options related to saving or exporting the model for use in different environments or platforms. These settings can impact the model's performance, size, and compatibility with various systems. Key export settings include the exported model file format (e.g., ONNX, TensorFlow SavedModel), the target device (e.g., CPU, GPU), and additional features such as masks or multiple labels per box. The export process may also be affected by the model's specific task and the requirements or constraints of the destination environment or platform. It is crucial to thoughtfully configure these settings to ensure the exported model is optimized for the intended use case and functions effectively in the target environment.

## Augmentation

Augmentation settings for YOLO models refer to the various transformations and modifications applied to the training data to increase the diversity and size of the dataset. These settings can affect the model's performance, speed, and accuracy. Some common YOLO augmentation settings include the type and intensity of the transformations applied (e.g. random flips, rotations, cropping, color changes), the probability with which each transformation is applied, and the presence of additional features such as masks or multiple labels per box. Other factors that may affect the augmentation process include the size and composition of the original dataset and the specific task the model is being used for. It is important to carefully tune and experiment with these settings to ensure that the augmented dataset is diverse and representative enough to train a high-performing model.

## Logging, checkpoints, plotting and file management

Logging, checkpoints, plotting, and file management are important considerations when training a YOLO model.

- Logging: It is often helpful to log various metrics and statistics during training to track the model's progress and diagnose any issues that may arise. This can be done using a logging library such as TensorBoard or by writing log messages to a file.
- Checkpoints: It is a good practice to save checkpoints of the model at regular intervals during training. This allows you to resume training from a previous point if the training process is interrupted or if you want to experiment with different training configurations.
- Plotting: Visualizing the model's performance and training progress can be helpful for understanding how the model is behaving and identifying potential issues. This can be done using a plotting library such as matplotlib or by generating plots using a logging library such as TensorBoard.
- File management: Managing the various files generated during the training process, such as model checkpoints, log files, and plots, can be challenging. It is important to have a clear and organized file structure to keep track of these files and make it easy to access and analyze them as needed.

Effective logging, checkpointing, plotting, and file management can help you keep track of the model's progress and make it easier to debug and optimize the training process.

Changes in version 1.0:
  - First release as a GNU package
  - License change: LGPLv3+ for code, GFDLv1.3+ (with no invariant sections)
    for documentation
  - 100% of all lines are covered by tests
  - Functions renamed:
    mpc_mul_2exp to mpc_mul_2ui, mpc_div_2exp to mpc_div_2ui
  - 0^0, which returned (NaN,NaN) previously, now returns (1,+0)
  - Removed compatibility with K&R compilers, untestable due to lack of
    such compilers
  - New functions: mpc_log10, mpc_mul_2si, mpc_div_2si
  - Speed-ups:
    - mpc_fma
  - Bug fixes:
    - mpc_div and mpc_norm now return a value indicating the effective
      rounding direction, as the other functions
    - mpc_mul, mpc_sqr and mpc_norm now return correct results even if there
      are over- or underflows during the computation
    - mpc_asin, mpc_proj, mpc_sqr: Wrong result when input variable has
      infinite part and equals output variable is corrected
    - mpc_fr_sub: Wrong return value for imaginary part is corrected

Changes in version 0.9:
  - New functions:
    - mpc_set_dc, mpc_set_ldc, mpc_get_dc, mpc_get_ldc for converting
      between mpc type variables and C variables of type double _Complex
      or long double _Complex
    - mpc_sin_cos, computing simultaneously the sine and cosine
  - Speed-ups:
    - mpc_pow_si through binary exponentiation
    - mpc_pow_z when the exponent fits in a long
    - mpc_tan through the use of mpc_sin_cos
  - Bug fixes:
    - trigonometric functions: infinite loop due to overflow for large
      arguments
    - mpc_exp: close to infinite loop for argument close to 0
    - mpc_sqrt: close to infinite loop for argument close to 1
    - mpc_add_si: replaced macro by function, since the macro evaluated the
      same expression twice
  - Logging feature for debugging:
      ./configure --enable-logging
      #include "mpc-log.h" instead of #include "mpc.h"
  - Minimally required library versions: gmp 4.3.2, mpfr 2.4.2

  - Speed-up of mpc_pow_ui through binary exponentiation

Changes in version 0.8.1:

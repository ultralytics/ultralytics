# TT100K Dataset

The [Tsinghua-Tencent 100K (TT100K)](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/traffic-sign/) is a large-scale traffic sign benchmark dataset created from 100,000 Tencent Street View panoramas. This dataset is specifically designed for traffic sign detection and classification in real-world conditions, providing researchers and developers with a comprehensive resource for building robust traffic sign recognition systems.

The dataset contains **100,000 images** with over **30,000 traffic sign instances** across **221 different categories**. These images capture large variations in illuminance, weather conditions, viewing angles, and distances, making it ideal for training models that need to perform reliably in diverse real-world scenarios.

This dataset is particularly valuable for:

    === "Python"

        ```python

        # Train the model - dataset will auto-download on first run
        results = model.train(data="TT100K.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Start training from a pretrained *.pt model

        yolo detect train data=TT100K.yaml model=yolo26n.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640
        ```

## Sample Images and Annotations

Here are typical examples from the TT100K dataset:

1. **Urban environments**: Street scenes with multiple traffic signs at various distances
2. **Highway scenes**: High-speed road signs including speed limits and direction indicators
3. **Complex intersections**: Multiple signs in close proximity with varying orientations
4. **Challenging conditions**: Signs under different lighting (day/night), weather (rain/fog), and viewing angles

The dataset includes:

1. **Close-up signs**: Large, clearly visible signs occupying significant image area
2. **Distant signs**: Small signs requiring fine-grained detection capabilities
3. **Partially occluded signs**: Signs partially blocked by vehicles, trees, or other objects
4. **Multiple signs per image**: Images containing several different sign types

### How can I train a YOLO26n model using the TT100K dataset?

To train a YOLO26n model on the TT100K dataset for 100 epochs with an image size of 640, use the example below.

!!! example "Train Example"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("yolo26n.pt")  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)

        # Train the model
        results = model.train(data="TT100K.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)
        ```


    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Start training from a pretrained *.pt model
        yolo detect train data=TT100K.yaml model=yolo26n.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640
        ```

For detailed training configurations, refer to the [Training](../../modes/train.md) documentation.

### What makes TT100K challenging compared to other datasets?

TT100K presents several unique challenges:

1. **Scale variation**: Signs range from very small (distant highway signs) to large (close-up urban signs)
2. **Real-world conditions**: Extreme variations in lighting, weather, and viewing angles
3. **High resolution**: 2048×2048 pixel images require significant processing power
4. **Class imbalance**: Some sign types are much more common than others
5. **Dense scenes**: Multiple signs may appear in a single image
6. **Partial occlusion**: Signs may be partially blocked by vehicles, vegetation, or structures

These challenges make TT100K a valuable benchmark for developing robust detection algorithms.

### How do I handle the large image sizes in TT100K?

The TT100K dataset uses 2048×2048 pixel images, which can be resource-intensive. Here are recommended strategies:

**For Training:**

```python
# Option 1: Resize to standard YOLO size
model.train(data="TT100K.yaml", imgsz=640, batch=16)

# Option 2: Use larger size for better small object detection
model.train(data="TT100K.yaml", imgsz=1280, batch=4)

# Option 3: Multi-scale training
model.train(data="TT100K.yaml", imgsz=640, scale=0.5)  # trains at varying scales
```

**Recommendations:**

- Start with `imgsz=640` for initial experiments
- Use `imgsz=1280` if you have sufficient GPU memory (24GB+)
- Consider tiling strategies for very small signs
- Use gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch sizes

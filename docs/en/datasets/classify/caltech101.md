# Caltech-101 Dataset

The [Caltech-101](https://data.caltech.edu/records/mzrjq-6wc02) dataset is a widely used dataset for object recognition tasks, containing around 9,000 images from 101 object categories. The categories were chosen to reflect a variety of real-world objects, and the images themselves were carefully selected and annotated to provide a challenging benchmark for object recognition algorithms.

## Key Features

- The Caltech-101 dataset comprises around 9,000 color images divided into 101 categories.
- The categories encompass a wide variety of objects, including animals, vehicles, household items, and people.
- The number of images per category varies, with about 40 to 800 images in each category.
- Images are of variable sizes, with most images being medium resolution.
- Caltech-101 is widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning, particularly for object recognition tasks.

## Dataset Structure

Unlike many other datasets, the Caltech-101 dataset is not formally split into training and testing sets. Users typically create their own splits based on their specific needs. However, a common practice is to use a random subset of images for training (e.g., 30 images per category) and the remaining images for testing.

## Applications

The Caltech-101 dataset is extensively used for training and evaluating [deep learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/deep-learning-dl) models in object recognition tasks, such as [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/convolutional-neural-network-cnn) (CNNs), [Support Vector Machines](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/support-vector-machine-svm) (SVMs), and various other machine learning algorithms. Its wide variety of categories and high-quality images make it an excellent dataset for research and development in the field of [machine learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml) and [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv).

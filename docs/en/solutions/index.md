        model="yolo11n.pt",  # model="yolo11n-obb.pt" for object counting with OBB model.
        # classes=[0, 2],           # count specific classes i.e. person and car with COCO pretrained model.
        # tracker="botsort.yaml"    # Choose trackers i.e "bytetrack.yaml"
    )
    results = counter.count(im0)
    print(results.in_counts)  # display in_counts
    print(results.out_counts)  # display out_counts
    ```

    - **ARGS** (optional) are custom `arg=value` pairs, such as `show_in=True`, to override default settings.

```bash
yolo solutions count show=True  # for object counting

yolo solutions source="path/to/video/file.mp4"  # specify video file path
```

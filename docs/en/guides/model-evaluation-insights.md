# Insights on Model Evaluation and Fine-Tuning

## Introduction

Once you've [trained](./model-training-tips.md) your computer vision model, evaluating and refining it to perform optimally is essential. Just training your model isn't enough. You need to make sure that your model is accurate, efficient, and fulfills the [objective](./defining-project-goals.md) of your computer vision project. By evaluating and fine-tuning your model, you can identify weaknesses, improve its accuracy, and boost overall performance.

In this guide, we'll share insights on model evaluation and fine-tuning that'll make this [step of a computer vision project](./steps-of-a-cv-project.md) more approachable. We'll discuss how to understand evaluation metrics and implement fine-tuning techniques, giving you the knowledge to elevate your model's capabilities.

## Evaluating Model Performance Using Metrics

Evaluating how well a model performs helps us understand how effectively it works. Various metrics are used to measure performance. These [performance metrics](./yolo-performance-metrics.md) provide clear, numerical insights that can guide improvements toward making sure the model meets its intended goals. Let's take a closer look at a few key metrics.

### Confidence Score

The confidence score represents the model's certainty that a detected object belongs to a particular class. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating greater confidence. The confidence score helps filter predictions; only detections with confidence scores above a specified threshold are considered valid.

_Quick Tip:_ When running inferences, if you aren't seeing any predictions and you've checked everything else, try lowering the confidence score. Sometimes, the threshold is too high, causing the model to ignore valid predictions. Lowering the score allows the model to consider more possibilities. This might not meet your project goals, but it's a good way to see what the model can do and decide how to fine-tune it.

### Intersection over Union

[Intersection over Union](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/intersection-over-union-iou) (IoU) is a metric in [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) that measures how well the predicted [bounding box](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/bounding-box) overlaps with the ground truth bounding box. IoU values range from 0 to 1, where one stands for a perfect match. IoU is essential because it measures how closely the predicted boundaries match the actual object boundaries.

### Mean Average [Precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/precision)

[Mean Average Precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/mean-average-precision-map) (mAP) is a way to measure how well an object detection model performs. It looks at the precision of detecting each object class, averages these scores, and gives an overall number that shows how accurately the model can identify and classify objects.

Let's focus on two specific mAP metrics:

- *mAP@.5:* Measures the average precision at a single IoU (Intersection over Union) threshold of 0.5. This metric checks if the model can correctly find objects with a looser [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy) requirement. It focuses on whether the object is roughly in the right place, not needing perfect placement. It helps see if the model is generally good at spotting objects.
- *mAP@.5:.95:* Averages the mAP values calculated at multiple IoU thresholds, from 0.5 to 0.95 in 0.05 increments. This metric is more detailed and strict. It gives a fuller picture of how accurately the model can find objects at different levels of strictness and is especially useful for applications that need precise object detection.

Other mAP metrics include mAP@0.75, which uses a stricter IoU threshold of 0.75, and mAP@small, medium, and large, which evaluate precision across objects of different sizes.

## Evaluating YOLO11 Model Performance

With respect to YOLO11, you can use the [validation mode](../modes/val.md) to evaluate the model. Also, be sure to take a look at our guide that goes in-depth into [YOLO11 performance metrics](./yolo-performance-metrics.md) and how they can be interpreted.

### Common Community Questions

When evaluating your YOLO11 model, you might run into a few hiccups. Based on common community questions, here are some tips to help you get the most out of your YOLO11 model:

#### Handling Variable Image Sizes

Evaluating your YOLO11 model with images of different sizes can help you understand its performance on diverse datasets. Using the `rect=true` validation parameter, YOLO11 adjusts the network's stride for each batch based on the image sizes, allowing the model to handle rectangular images without forcing them to a single size.

The `imgsz` validation parameter sets the maximum dimension for image resizing, which is 640 by default. You can adjust this based on your dataset's maximum dimensions and the GPU memory available. Even with `imgsz` set, `rect=true` lets the model manage varying image sizes effectively by dynamically adjusting the stride.

#### Accessing YOLO11 Metrics

If you want to get a deeper understanding of your YOLO11 model's performance, you can easily access specific evaluation metrics with a few lines of Python code. The code snippet below will let you load your model, run an evaluation, and print out various metrics that show how well your model is doing.

!!! example "Usage"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load the model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Run the evaluation
        results = model.val(data="coco8.yaml")

        ```

The results object also includes speed metrics like preprocess time, inference time, loss, and postprocess time. By analyzing these metrics, you can fine-tune and optimize your YOLO11 model for better performance, making it more effective for your specific use case.

## How Does Fine-Tuning Work?

Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained model and adjusting its parameters to improve performance on a specific task or dataset. The process, also known as model retraining, allows the model to better understand and predict outcomes for the specific data it will encounter in real-world applications. You can retrain your model based on your model evaluation to achieve optimal results.

## Tips for Fine-Tuning Your Model

Fine-tuning a model means paying close attention to several vital parameters and techniques to achieve optimal performance. Here are some essential tips to guide you through the process.

### Starting With a Higher [Learning Rate](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/learning-rate)

Usually, during the initial training [epochs](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/epoch), the learning rate starts low and gradually increases to stabilize the training process. However, since your model has already learned some features from the previous dataset, starting with a higher learning rate right away can be more beneficial.

When evaluating your YOLO11 model, you can set the `warmup_epochs` validation parameter to `warmup_epochs=0` to prevent the learning rate from starting too high. By following this process, the training will continue from the provided weights, adjusting to the nuances of your new data.

### Image Tiling for Small Objects

Image tiling can improve detection accuracy for small objects. By dividing larger images into smaller segments, such as splitting 1280x1280 images into multiple 640x640 segments, you maintain the original resolution, and the model can learn from high-resolution fragments. When using YOLO11, make sure to adjust your labels for these new segments correctly.

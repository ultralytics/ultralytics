# Pose Estimation Datasets Overview

## Supported Dataset Formats

### Ultralytics YOLO format

The dataset label format used for training YOLO pose models is as follows:

1. One text file per image: Each image in the dataset has a corresponding text file with the same name as the image file and the ".txt" extension.
2. One row per object: Each row in the text file corresponds to one object instance in the image.
3. Object information per row: Each row contains the following information about the object instance:
    - Object class index: An integer representing the class of the object (e.g., 0 for person, 1 for car, etc.).
    - Object center coordinates: The x and y coordinates of the center of the object, normalized to be between 0 and 1.
    - Object width and height: The width and height of the object, normalized to be between 0 and 1.
    - Object keypoint coordinates: The keypoints of the object, normalized to be between 0 and 1.

Here is an example of the label format for pose estimation task:

Format with Dim = 2

```
<class-index> <x> <y> <width> <height> <px1> <py1> <px2> <py2> ... <pxn> <pyn>
```

Format with Dim = 3

```
<class-index> <x> <y> <width> <height> <px1> <py1> <p1-visibility> <px2> <py2> <p2-visibility> <pxn> <pyn> <p2-visibility>
```

In this format, `<class-index>` is the index of the class for the object,`<x> <y> <width> <height>` are coordinates of [bounding box](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/bounding-box), and `<px1> <py1> <px2> <py2> ... <pxn> <pyn>` are the pixel coordinates of the keypoints. The coordinates are separated by spaces.

### Dataset YAML format

The Ultralytics framework uses a YAML file format to define the dataset and model configuration for training Detection Models. Here is an example of the YAML format used for defining a detection dataset:

```yaml
# Train/val/test sets as 1) dir: path/to/imgs, 2) file: path/to/imgs.txt, or 3) list: [path/to/imgs1, path/to/imgs2, ..]
path: ../datasets/coco8-pose # dataset root dir
train: images/train # train images (relative to 'path') 4 images
val: images/val # val images (relative to 'path') 4 images
test: # test images (optional)

# Keypoints
kpt_shape: [17, 3] # number of keypoints, number of dims (2 for x,y or 3 for x,y,visible)
flip_idx: [0, 2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, 10, 9, 12, 11, 14, 13, 16, 15]

# Classes dictionary
names:
    0: person
```

The `train` and `val` fields specify the paths to the directories containing the training and validation images, respectively.

`names` is a dictionary of class names. The order of the names should match the order of the object class indices in the YOLO dataset files.

(Optional) if the points are symmetric then need flip_idx, like left-right side of human or face. For example if we assume five keypoints of facial landmark: [left eye, right eye, nose, left mouth, right mouth], and the original index is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], then flip_idx is [1, 0, 2, 4, 3] (just exchange the left-right index, i.e. 0-1 and 3-4, and do not modify others like nose in this example).

Convert your annotations to the required format and specify the paths, number of classes, and class names in the YAML configuration file.

### Conversion Tool

Ultralytics provides a convenient conversion tool to convert labels from the popular COCO dataset format to YOLO format:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics.data.converter import convert_coco

        convert_coco(labels_dir="path/to/coco/annotations/", use_keypoints=True)
        ```

This conversion tool can be used to convert the COCO dataset or any dataset in the COCO format to the Ultralytics YOLO format. The `use_keypoints` parameter specifies whether to include keypoints (for pose estimation) in the converted labels.

## FAQ

### What is the Ultralytics YOLO format for pose estimation?

The Ultralytics YOLO format for pose estimation datasets involves labeling each image with a corresponding text file. Each row of the text file stores information about an object instance:

- Object class index
- Object center coordinates (normalized x and y)
- Object width and height (normalized)
- Object keypoint coordinates (normalized pxn and pyn)

For 2D poses, keypoints include pixel coordinates. For 3D, each keypoint also has a visibility flag. For more details, see [Ultralytics YOLO format](#ultralytics-yolo-format).

### How do I use the COCO-Pose dataset with Ultralytics YOLO?

To use the COCO-Pose dataset with Ultralytics YOLO:

1. Download the dataset and prepare your label files in the YOLO format.
2. Create a YAML configuration file specifying paths to training and validation images, keypoint shape, and class names.

# Machine Learning Best Practices and Tips for Model Training

## Introduction

One of the most important steps when working on a [computer vision project](./steps-of-a-cv-project.md) is model training. Before reaching this step, you need to [define your goals](./defining-project-goals.md) and [collect and annotate your data](./data-collection-and-annotation.md). After [preprocessing the data](./preprocessing_annotated_data.md) to make sure it is clean and consistent, you can move on to training your model.

So, what is [model training](../modes/train.md)? Model training is the process of teaching your model to recognize visual patterns and make predictions based on your data. It directly impacts the performance and accuracy of your application. In this guide, we'll cover best practices, optimization techniques, and troubleshooting tips to help you train your computer vision models effectively.

## How to Train a [Machine Learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml) Model

A computer vision model is trained by adjusting its internal parameters to minimize errors. Initially, the model is fed a large set of labeled images. It makes predictions about what is in these images, and the predictions are compared to the actual labels or contents to calculate errors. These errors show how far off the model's predictions are from the true values.

During training, the model iteratively makes predictions, calculates errors, and updates its parameters through a process called [backpropagation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/backpropagation). In this process, the model adjusts its internal parameters (weights and biases) to reduce the errors. By repeating this cycle many times, the model gradually improves its accuracy. Over time, it learns to recognize complex patterns such as shapes, colors, and textures.

</p>

This learning process makes it possible for the [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) model to perform various [tasks](../tasks/index.md), including [object detection](../tasks/detect.md), [instance segmentation](../tasks/segment.md), and [image classification](../tasks/classify.md). The ultimate goal is to create a model that can generalize its learning to new, unseen images so that it can accurately understand visual data in real-world applications.

Now that we know what is happening behind the scenes when we train a model, let's look at points to consider when training a model.

## Training on Large Datasets

There are a few different aspects to think about when you are planning on using a large dataset to train a model. For example, you can adjust the batch size, control the GPU utilization, choose to use multiscale training, etc. Let's walk through each of these options in detail.

### Batch Size and GPU Utilization

When training models on large datasets, efficiently utilizing your GPU is key. Batch size is an important factor. It is the number of data samples that a machine learning model processes in a single training iteration.
Using the maximum batch size supported by your GPU, you can fully take advantage of its capabilities and reduce the time model training takes. However, you want to avoid running out of GPU memory. If you encounter memory errors, reduce the batch size incrementally until the model trains smoothly.

With respect to YOLO11, you can set the `batch_size` parameter in the [training configuration](../modes/train.md) to match your GPU capacity. Also, setting `batch=-1` in your training script will automatically determine the [batch size](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/batch-size) that can be efficiently processed based on your device's capabilities. By fine-tuning the batch size, you can make the most of your GPU resources and improve the overall training process.

### Subset Training

Subset training is a smart strategy that involves training your model on a smaller set of data that represents the larger dataset. It can save time and resources, especially during initial model development and testing. If you are running short on time or experimenting with different model configurations, subset training is a good option.

When it comes to YOLO11, you can easily implement subset training by using the `fraction` parameter. This parameter lets you specify what fraction of your dataset to use for training. For example, setting `fraction=0.1` will train your model on 10% of the data. You can use this technique for quick iterations and tuning your model before committing to training a model using a full dataset. Subset training helps you make rapid progress and identify potential issues early on.

### Multi-scale Training

Multiscale training is a technique that improves your model's ability to generalize by training it on images of varying sizes. Your model can learn to detect objects at different scales and distances and become more robust.

For example, when you train YOLO11, you can enable multiscale training by setting the `scale` parameter. This parameter adjusts the size of training images by a specified factor, simulating objects at different distances. For example, setting `scale=0.5` randomly zooms training images by a factor between 0.5 and 1.5 during training. Configuring this parameter allows your model to experience a variety of image scales and improve its detection capabilities across different object sizes and scenarios.

### Caching

Caching is an important technique to improve the efficiency of training machine learning models. By storing preprocessed images in memory, caching reduces the time the GPU spends waiting for data to be loaded from the disk. The model can continuously receive data without delays caused by disk I/O operations.

Caching can be controlled when training YOLO11 using the `cache` parameter:

- _`cache=True`_: Stores dataset images in RAM, providing the fastest access speed but at the cost of increased memory usage.
- _`cache='disk'`_: Stores the images on disk, slower than RAM but faster than loading fresh data each time.
- _`cache=False`_: Disables caching, relying entirely on disk I/O, which is the slowest option.

### Mixed Precision Training

Mixed precision training uses both 16-bit (FP16) and 32-bit (FP32) floating-point types. The strengths of both FP16 and FP32 are leveraged by using FP16 for faster computation and FP32 to maintain precision where needed. Most of the [neural network](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/neural-network-nn)'s operations are done in FP16 to benefit from faster computation and lower memory usage. However, a master copy of the model's weights is kept in FP32 to ensure accuracy during the weight update steps. You can handle larger models or larger batch sizes within the same hardware constraints.

<p align="center">
  <img width="100%" src="https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/mixed-precision-training-overview.avif" alt="Mixed Precision Training Overview">
</p>

To implement mixed precision training, you'll need to modify your training scripts and ensure your hardware (like GPUs) supports it. Many modern [deep learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/deep-learning-dl) frameworks, such as [Tensorflow](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/tensorflow), offer built-in support for mixed precision.

Mixed precision training is straightforward when working with YOLO11. You can use the `amp` flag in your training configuration. Setting `amp=True` enables Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) training. Mixed precision training is a simple yet effective way to optimize your model training process.

### Pre-trained Weights

Using pretrained weights is a smart way to speed up your model's training process. Pretrained weights come from models already trained on large datasets, giving your model a head start. [Transfer learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/transfer-learning) adapts pretrained models to new, related tasks. Fine-tuning a pre-trained model involves starting with these weights and then continuing training on your specific dataset. This method of training results in faster training times and often better performance because the model starts with a solid understanding of basic features.

The `pretrained` parameter makes transfer learning easy with YOLO11. Setting `pretrained=True` will use default pre-trained weights, or you can specify a path to a custom pre-trained model. Using pre-trained weights and transfer learning effectively boosts your model's capabilities and reduces training costs.

### Other Techniques to Consider When Handling a Large Dataset

There are a couple of other techniques to consider when handling a large dataset:

- **[Learning Rate](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/learning-rate) Schedulers**: Implementing learning rate schedulers dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training. A well-tuned learning rate can prevent the model from overshooting minima and improve stability. When training YOLO11, the `lrf` parameter helps manage learning rate scheduling by setting the final learning rate as a fraction of the initial rate.
- **Distributed Training**: For handling large datasets, distributed training can be a game-changer. You can reduce the training time by spreading the training workload across multiple GPUs or machines.

## The Number of Epochs To Train For

When training a model, an epoch refers to one complete pass through the entire training dataset. During an epoch, the model processes each example in the training set once and updates its parameters based on the learning algorithm. Multiple epochs are usually needed to allow the model to learn and refine its parameters over time.

A common question that comes up is how to determine the number of epochs to train the model for. A good starting point is 300 epochs. If the model overfits early, you can reduce the number of epochs. If [overfitting](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/overfitting) does not occur after 300 epochs, you can extend the training to 600, 1200, or more epochs.

However, the ideal number of epochs can vary based on your dataset's size and project goals. Larger datasets might require more epochs for the model to learn effectively, while smaller datasets might need fewer epochs to avoid overfitting. With respect to YOLO11, you can set the `epochs` parameter in your training script.

## Early Stopping

Early stopping is a valuable technique for optimizing model training. By monitoring validation performance, you can halt training once the model stops improving. You can save computational resources and prevent overfitting.

The process involves setting a patience parameter that determines how many [epochs](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/epoch) to wait for an improvement in validation metrics before stopping training. If the model's performance does not improve within these epochs, training is stopped to avoid wasting time and resources.

<p align="center">
  <img width="100%" src="https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/early-stopping-overview.avif" alt="Early Stopping Overview">
</p>

For YOLO11, you can enable early stopping by setting the patience parameter in your training configuration. For example, `patience=5` means training will stop if there's no improvement in validation metrics for 5 consecutive epochs. Using this method ensures the training process remains efficient and achieves optimal performance without excessive computation.

## Choosing Between Cloud and Local Training

There are two options for training your model: cloud training and local training.

Cloud training offers scalability and powerful hardware and is ideal for handling large datasets and complex models. Platforms like Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure provide on-demand access to high-performance GPUs and TPUs, speeding up training times and enabling experiments with larger models. However, cloud training can be expensive, especially for long periods, and data transfer can add to costs and latency.

Local training provides greater control and customization, letting you tailor your environment to specific needs and avoid ongoing cloud costs. It can be more economical for long-term projects, and since your data stays on-premises, it's more secure. However, local hardware may have resource limitations and require maintenance, which can lead to longer training times for large models.

## Selecting an Optimizer

An optimizer is an algorithm that adjusts the weights of your neural network to minimize the [loss function](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/loss-function), which measures how well the model is performing. In simpler terms, the optimizer helps the model learn by tweaking its parameters to reduce errors. Choosing the right optimizer directly affects how quickly and accurately the model learns.

You can also fine-tune optimizer parameters to improve model performance. Adjusting the learning rate sets the size of the steps when updating parameters. For stability, you might start with a moderate learning rate and gradually decrease it over time to improve long-term learning. Additionally, setting the momentum determines how much influence past updates have on current updates. A common value for momentum is around 0.9. It generally provides a good balance.

### Common Optimizers

Different optimizers have various strengths and weaknesses. Let's take a glimpse at a few common optimizers.

- **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**:

    - Updates model parameters using the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters.
    - Simple and efficient but can be slow to converge and might get stuck in local minima.

- **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**:

    - Combines the benefits of both SGD with momentum and RMSProp.
    - Adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on estimates of the first and second moments of the gradients.
    - Well-suited for noisy data and sparse gradients.
    - Efficient and generally requires less tuning, making it a recommended optimizer for YOLO11.

- **RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation)**:
    - Adjusts the learning rate for each parameter by dividing the gradient by a running average of the magnitudes of recent gradients.
    - Helps in handling the vanishing gradient problem and is effective for [recurrent neural networks](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/recurrent-neural-network-rnn).

For YOLO11, the `optimizer` parameter lets you choose from various optimizers, including SGD, Adam, AdamW, NAdam, RAdam, and RMSProp, or you can set it to `auto` for automatic selection based on model configuration.

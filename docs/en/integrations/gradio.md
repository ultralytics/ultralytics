# Interactive Object Detection: Gradio & Ultralytics YOLO11 ðŸš€

## Introduction to Interactive Object Detection

This Gradio interface provides an easy and interactive way to perform [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) using the [Ultralytics YOLO11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/) model. Users can upload images and adjust parameters like confidence threshold and intersection-over-union (IoU) threshold to get real-time detection results.

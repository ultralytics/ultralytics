class PosePredictor(DetectionPredictor):
    """
    A class extending the DetectionPredictor class for prediction based on a pose model.

    This class specializes in pose estimation, handling keypoints detection alongside standard object detection
    capabilities inherited from DetectionPredictor.

    Attributes:
        args (namespace): Configuration arguments for the predictor.
        model (torch.nn.Module): The loaded YOLO pose model with keypoint detection capabilities.

    Methods:
        construct_result: Constructs the result object from the prediction, including keypoints.

    Examples:
        >>> from ultralytics.utils import ASSETS
        >>> from ultralytics.models.yolo.pose import PosePredictor
        >>> args = dict(model="yolo11n-pose.pt", source=ASSETS)

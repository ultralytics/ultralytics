| Argument        | Type           | Default                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source`        | `str`          | `'ultralytics/assets'` | Specifies the data source for inference. Can be an image path, video file, directory, URL, or device ID for live feeds. Supports a wide range of formats and sources, enabling flexible application across [different types of input](/modes/predict.md/#inference-sources).                                   |
| `conf`          | `float`        | `0.25`                 | Sets the minimum confidence threshold for detections. Objects detected with confidence below this threshold will be disregarded. Adjusting this value can help reduce false positives.                                                                                                                         |
| `iou`           | `float`        | `0.7`                  | [Intersection Over Union](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/intersection-over-union-iou) (IoU) threshold for Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Lower values result in fewer detections by eliminating overlapping boxes, useful for reducing duplicates.                                                       |
| `imgsz`         | `int or tuple` | `640`                  | Defines the image size for inference. Can be a single integer `640` for square resizing or a (height, width) tuple. Proper sizing can improve detection [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy) and processing speed.                                                                        |
| `half`          | `bool`         | `False`                | Enables half-[precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/precision) (FP16) inference, which can speed up model inference on supported GPUs with minimal impact on accuracy.                                                                                                                               |
| `device`        | `str`          | `None`                 | Specifies the device for inference (e.g., `cpu`, `cuda:0` or `0`). Allows users to select between CPU, a specific GPU, or other compute devices for model execution.                                                                                                                                           |
| `batch`         | `int`          | `1`                    | Specifies the batch size for inference (only works when the source is [a directory, video file or `.txt` file](/modes/predict.md/#inference-sources)). A larger batch size can provide higher throughput, shortening the total amount of time required for inference.                                          |
| `max_det`       | `int`          | `300`                  | Maximum number of detections allowed per image. Limits the total number of objects the model can detect in a single inference, preventing excessive outputs in dense scenes.                                                                                                                                   |
| `vid_stride`    | `int`          | `1`                    | Frame stride for video inputs. Allows skipping frames in videos to speed up processing at the cost of temporal resolution. A value of 1 processes every frame, higher values skip frames.                                                                                                                      |
| `stream_buffer` | `bool`         | `False`                | Determines whether to queue incoming frames for video streams. If `False`, old frames get dropped to accomodate new frames (optimized for real-time applications). If `True', queues new frames in a buffer, ensuring no frames get skipped, but will cause latency if inference FPS is lower than stream FPS. |
| `visualize`     | `bool`         | `False`                | Activates visualization of model features during inference, providing insights into what the model is "seeing". Useful for debugging and model interpretation.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `augment`       | `bool`         | `False`                | Enables test-time augmentation (TTA) for predictions, potentially improving detection robustness at the cost of inference speed.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `agnostic_nms`  | `bool`         | `False`                | Enables class-agnostic Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), which merges overlapping boxes of different classes. Useful in multi-class detection scenarios where class overlap is common.                                                                                                                            |
| `classes`       | `list[int]`    | `None`                 | Filters predictions to a set of class IDs. Only detections belonging to the specified classes will be returned. Useful for focusing on relevant objects in multi-class detection tasks.                                                                                                                        |
| `retina_masks`  | `bool`         | `False`                | Returns high-resolution segmentation masks. The returned masks (`masks.data`) will match the original image size if enabled. If disabled, they have the image size used during inference.                                                                                                                      |
| `embed`         | `list[int]`    | `None`                 | Specifies the layers from which to extract feature vectors or [embeddings](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/embeddings). Useful for downstream tasks like clustering or similarity search.                                                                                                                 |
| `project`       | `str`          | `None`                 | Name of the project directory where prediction outputs are saved if `save` is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `name`          | `str`          | `None`                 | Name of the prediction run. Used for creating a subdirectory within the project folder, where prediction outputs are stored if `save` is enabled.                                                                                                                                                              |

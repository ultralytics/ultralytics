# Medical Pills Dataset

The medical-pills detection dataset is a proof-of-concept (POC) dataset, carefully curated to demonstrate the potential of AI in pharmaceutical applications. It contains labeled images specifically designed to train [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) [models](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/) for identifying medical-pills. This dataset serves as a foundational resource for automating essential [tasks](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/) such as quality control, packaging automation, and efficient sorting in pharmaceutical workflows. By integrating this dataset into projects, researchers and developers can explore innovative [solutions](https://docs.ultralytics.com/solutions/) that enhance [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy), streamline operations, and ultimately contribute to improved healthcare outcomes.

## Dataset Structure

The medical-pills dataset is divided into two subsets:

- **Training set**: Consisting of 92 images, each annotated with the class `pill`.
- **Validation set**: Comprising 23 images with corresponding annotations.

## Applications

Using computer vision for medical-pills detection enables automation in the pharmaceutical industry, supporting tasks like:

- **Pharmaceutical Sorting**: Automating the sorting of pills based on size, shape, or color to enhance production efficiency.
- **AI Research and Development**: Serving as a benchmark for developing and testing computer vision algorithms in pharmaceutical use cases.
- **Digital Inventory Systems**: Powering smart inventory solutions by integrating automated pill recognition for real-time stock monitoring and replenishment planning.

## Dataset YAML

A YAML configuration file is provided to define the dataset's structure, including paths and classes. For the medical-pills dataset, the `medical-pills.yaml` file can be accessed at [https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/medical-pills.yaml](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/medical-pills.yaml).

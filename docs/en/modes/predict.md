## Introduction

In the world of [machine learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml) and [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv), the process of making sense out of visual data is called 'inference' or 'prediction'. Ultralytics YOLO11 offers a powerful feature known as **predict mode** that is tailored for high-performance, real-time inference on a wide range of data sources.

## Why Use Ultralytics YOLO for Inference?

Here's why you should consider YOLO11's predict mode for your various inference needs:

- **Versatility:** Capable of making inferences on images, videos, and even live streams.
- **Performance:** Engineered for real-time, high-speed processing without sacrificing [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy).
- **Ease of Use:** Intuitive Python and CLI interfaces for rapid deployment and testing.
- **Highly Customizable:** Various settings and parameters to tune the model's inference behavior according to your specific requirements.

### Key Features of Predict Mode

YOLO11's predict mode is designed to be robust and versatile, featuring:

- **Multiple Data Source Compatibility:** Whether your data is in the form of individual images, a collection of images, video files, or real-time video streams, predict mode has you covered.
- **Streaming Mode:** Use the streaming feature to generate a memory-efficient generator of `Results` objects. Enable this by setting `stream=True` in the predictor's call method.
- **Batch Processing:** The ability to process multiple images or video frames in a single batch, further speeding up inference time.
- **Integration Friendly:** Easily integrate with existing data pipelines and other software components, thanks to its flexible API.

Ultralytics YOLO models return either a Python list of `Results` objects, or a memory-efficient Python generator of `Results` objects when `stream=True` is passed to the model during inference:

!!! example "Predict"

    === "Return a list with `stream=False`"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")  # pretrained YOLO11n model

        # Run batched inference on a list of images
        results = model(["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg"])  # return a list of Results objects

        # Process results list
        for result in results:
            boxes = result.boxes  # Boxes object for bounding box outputs
            masks = result.masks  # Masks object for segmentation masks outputs
            keypoints = result.keypoints  # Keypoints object for pose outputs
            probs = result.probs  # Probs object for classification outputs
            obb = result.obb  # Oriented boxes object for OBB outputs
            result.show()  # display to screen
            result.save(filename="result.jpg")  # save to disk
        ```

    === "Return a generator with `stream=True`"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")  # pretrained YOLO11n model

        # Run batched inference on a list of images
        results = model(["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg"], stream=True)  # return a generator of Results objects

        # Process results generator
        for result in results:
            boxes = result.boxes  # Boxes object for bounding box outputs
            masks = result.masks  # Masks object for segmentation masks outputs
            keypoints = result.keypoints  # Keypoints object for pose outputs
            probs = result.probs  # Probs object for classification outputs
            obb = result.obb  # Oriented boxes object for OBB outputs
            result.show()  # display to screen
            result.save(filename="result.jpg")  # save to disk
        ```

## Inference Sources

YOLO11 can process different types of input sources for inference, as shown in the table below. The sources include static images, video streams, and various data formats. The table also indicates whether each source can be used in streaming mode with the argument `stream=True` ✅. Streaming mode is beneficial for processing videos or live streams as it creates a generator of results instead of loading all frames into memory.

!!! tip

    Use `stream=True` for processing long videos or large datasets to efficiently manage memory. When `stream=False`, the results for all frames or data points are stored in memory, which can quickly add up and cause out-of-memory errors for large inputs. In contrast, `stream=True` utilizes a generator, which only keeps the results of the current frame or data point in memory, significantly reducing memory consumption and preventing out-of-memory issues.

        results = model(source)  # list of Results objects
        ```

    === "video"

        Run inference on a video file. By using `stream=True`, you can create a generator of Results objects to reduce memory usage.
        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pretrained YOLO11n model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        results = model(source, stream=True)  # generator of Results objects
        ```

    === "directory"

        Run inference on all images and videos in a directory. To also capture images and videos in subdirectories use a glob pattern, i.e. `path/to/dir/**/*`.
        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pretrained YOLO11n model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Define path to directory containing images and videos for inference
        source = "path/to/dir"

        # Run inference on the source
        results = model(source, stream=True)  # generator of Results objects
        ```

    === "glob"

        Run inference on all images and videos that match a glob expression with `*` characters.

        # Load a pretrained YOLO11n model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Define a glob search for all JPG files in a directory
        source = "path/to/dir/*.jpg"

        # OR define a recursive glob search for all JPG files including subdirectories
        source = "path/to/dir/**/*.jpg"

        # Run inference on the source
        results = model(source, stream=True)  # generator of Results objects
        ```

    === "YouTube"

        Run inference on a YouTube video. By using `stream=True`, you can create a generator of Results objects to reduce memory usage for long videos.
        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pretrained YOLO11n model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Define source as YouTube video URL
        source = "https://youtu.be/LNwODJXcvt4"

        # Run inference on the source
        results = model(source, stream=True)  # generator of Results objects
        ```

    === "Stream"

        Use the stream mode to run inference on live video streams using RTSP, RTMP, TCP, or IP address protocols. If a single stream is provided, the model runs inference with a [batch size](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/batch-size) of 1. For multiple streams, a `.streams` text file can be used to perform batched inference, where the batch size is determined by the number of streams provided (e.g., batch-size 8 for 8 streams).

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pretrained YOLO11n model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Single stream with batch-size 1 inference
        source = "rtsp://example.com/media.mp4"  # RTSP, RTMP, TCP, or IP streaming address

        # Run inference on the source
        results = model(source, stream=True)  # generator of Results objects
        ```

        For single stream usage, the batch size is set to 1 by default, allowing efficient real-time processing of the video feed.

    === "Multi-Stream"

        To handle multiple video streams simultaneously, use a `.streams` text file containing the streaming sources. The model will run batched inference where the batch size equals the number of streams. This setup enables efficient processing of multiple feeds concurrently.

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pretrained YOLO11n model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Multiple streams with batched inference (e.g., batch-size 8 for 8 streams)
        source = "path/to/list.streams"  # *.streams text file with one streaming address per line

        # Run inference on the source
        results = model(source, stream=True)  # generator of Results objects
        ```

        Example `.streams` text file:

        ```txt
        rtsp://example.com/media1.mp4
        rtsp://example.com/media2.mp4
        rtmp://example2.com/live
        tcp://192.168.1.100:554
        ...
        ```

        Each row in the file represents a streaming source, allowing you to monitor and perform inference on several video streams at once.

    === "Webcam"

        You can run inference on a connected camera device by passing the index of that particular camera to `source`.

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pretrained YOLO11n model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Run inference on the source
        results = model(source=0, stream=True)  # generator of Results objects
        ```

## Inference Arguments

`model.predict()` accepts multiple arguments that can be passed at inference time to override defaults:

!!! example

    ```python
    from ultralytics import YOLO

    # Load a pretrained YOLO11n model
    model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

    # Run inference on 'bus.jpg' with arguments
    model.predict("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg", save=True, imgsz=320, conf=0.5)
    ```

Inference arguments:

{% include "macros/predict-args.md" %}

Visualization arguments:

{% include "macros/visualization-args.md" %}

## Plotting Results

The `plot()` method in `Results` objects facilitates visualization of predictions by overlaying detected objects (such as bounding boxes, masks, keypoints, and probabilities) onto the original image. This method returns the annotated image as a NumPy array, allowing for easy display or saving.

!!! example "Plotting"

    ```python
    from PIL import Image

    from ultralytics import YOLO

    # Load a pretrained YOLO11n model
    model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

    # Run inference on 'bus.jpg'
    results = model(["https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg", "https://ultralytics.com/images/zidane.jpg"])  # results list

    # Visualize the results
    for i, r in enumerate(results):
        # Plot results image
        im_bgr = r.plot()  # BGR-order numpy array
        im_rgb = Image.fromarray(im_bgr[..., ::-1])  # RGB-order PIL image

        # Show results to screen (in supported environments)
        r.show()

        # Save results to disk
        r.save(filename=f"results{i}.jpg")
    ```

## Thread-Safe Inference

Ensuring thread safety during inference is crucial when you are running multiple YOLO models in parallel across different threads. Thread-safe inference guarantees that each thread's predictions are isolated and do not interfere with one another, avoiding race conditions and ensuring consistent and reliable outputs.

When using YOLO models in a multi-threaded application, it's important to instantiate separate model objects for each thread or employ thread-local storage to prevent conflicts:

!!! example "Thread-Safe Inference"

    Instantiate a single model inside each thread for thread-safe inference:
    ```python
    from threading import Thread

    from ultralytics import YOLO


    def thread_safe_predict(model, image_path):
        """Performs thread-safe prediction on an image using a locally instantiated YOLO model."""
        model = YOLO(model)
        results = model.predict(image_path)
        # Process results


    # Starting threads that each have their own model instance
    Thread(target=thread_safe_predict, args=("yolo11n.pt", "image1.jpg")).start()
    Thread(target=thread_safe_predict, args=("yolo11n.pt", "image2.jpg")).start()
    ```

For an in-depth look at thread-safe inference with YOLO models and step-by-step instructions, please refer to our [YOLO Thread-Safe Inference Guide](../guides/yolo-thread-safe-inference.md). This guide will provide you with all the necessary information to avoid common pitfalls and ensure that your multi-threaded inference runs smoothly.

## Streaming Source `for`-loop

Here's a Python script using OpenCV (`cv2`) and YOLO to run inference on video frames. This script assumes you have already installed the necessary packages (`opencv-python` and `ultralytics`).

!!! example "Streaming for-loop"

    ```python
    import cv2

    from ultralytics import YOLO

    # Load the YOLO model
    model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

    # Open the video file
    video_path = "path/to/your/video/file.mp4"
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)

    # Loop through the video frames
    while cap.isOpened():
        # Read a frame from the video
        success, frame = cap.read()

        if success:
            # Run YOLO inference on the frame
            results = model(frame)

            # Visualize the results on the frame
            annotated_frame = results[0].plot()

            # Display the annotated frame
            cv2.imshow("YOLO Inference", annotated_frame)

            # Break the loop if 'q' is pressed
            if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord("q"):
                break
        else:
            # Break the loop if the end of the video is reached
            break

    # Release the video capture object and close the display window
    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    ```

This script will run predictions on each frame of the video, visualize the results, and display them in a window. The loop can be exited by pressing 'q'.

## FAQ

### What is Ultralytics YOLO and its predict mode for real-time inference?

Ultralytics YOLO is a state-of-the-art model for real-time [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection), segmentation, and classification. Its **predict mode** allows users to perform high-speed inference on various data sources such as images, videos, and live streams. Designed for performance and versatility, it also offers batch processing and streaming modes. For more details on its features, check out the [Ultralytics YOLO predict mode](#key-features-of-predict-mode).

### How can I run inference using Ultralytics YOLO on different data sources?

Ultralytics YOLO can process a wide range of data sources, including individual images, videos, directories, URLs, and streams. You can specify the data source in the `model.predict()` call. For example, use `'image.jpg'` for a local image or `'https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg'` for a URL. Check out the detailed examples for various [inference sources](#inference-sources) in the documentation.

### How do I optimize YOLO inference speed and memory usage?

To optimize inference speed and manage memory efficiently, you can use the streaming mode by setting `stream=True` in the predictor's call method. The streaming mode generates a memory-efficient generator of `Results` objects instead of loading all frames into memory. For processing long videos or large datasets, streaming mode is particularly useful. Learn more about [streaming mode](#key-features-of-predict-mode).

### What inference arguments does Ultralytics YOLO support?

The `model.predict()` method in YOLO supports various arguments such as `conf`, `iou`, `imgsz`, `device`, and more. These arguments allow you to customize the inference process, setting parameters like confidence thresholds, image size, and the device used for computation. Detailed descriptions of these arguments can be found in the [inference arguments](#inference-arguments) section.

### How can I visualize and save the results of YOLO predictions?

After running inference with YOLO, the `Results` objects contain methods for displaying and saving annotated images. You can use methods like `result.show()` and `result.save(filename="result.jpg")` to visualize and save the results. For a comprehensive list of these methods, refer to the [working with results](#working-with-results) section.

This comprehensive guide aims to give you an overview and practical insights into each mode, helping you harness the full potential of YOLO11.

## [Train](train.md)

Train mode is used for training a YOLO11 model on a custom dataset. In this mode, the model is trained using the specified dataset and hyperparameters. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters so that it can accurately predict the classes and locations of objects in an image. Training is essential for creating models that can recognize specific objects relevant to your application.

[Train Examples](train.md){ .md-button }

## [Val](val.md)

Val mode is used for validating a YOLO11 model after it has been trained. In this mode, the model is evaluated on a validation set to measure its accuracy and generalization performance. Validation helps identify potential issues like [overfitting](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/overfitting) and provides metrics such as [mean Average Precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/mean-average-precision-map) (mAP) to quantify model performance. This mode is crucial for tuning hyperparameters and improving overall model effectiveness.

[Val Examples](val.md){ .md-button }

## [Predict](predict.md)

Predict mode is used for making predictions using a trained YOLO11 model on new images or videos. In this mode, the model is loaded from a checkpoint file, and the user can provide images or videos to perform inference. The model identifies and localizes objects in the input media, making it ready for real-world applications. Predict mode is the gateway to applying your trained model to solve practical problems.

[Predict Examples](predict.md){ .md-button }

## [Export](export.md)

Export mode is used for converting a YOLO11 model to formats suitable for deployment across different platforms and devices. This mode transforms your PyTorch model into optimized formats like ONNX, TensorRT, or CoreML, enabling deployment in production environments. Exporting is essential for integrating your model with various software applications or hardware devices, often resulting in significant performance improvements.

[Export Examples](export.md){ .md-button }

## [Track](track.md)

Track mode extends YOLO11's object detection capabilities to track objects across video frames or live streams. This mode is particularly valuable for applications requiring persistent object identification, such as [surveillance systems](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/shattering-the-surveillance-status-quo-with-vision-ai) or [self-driving cars](https://www.ultralytics.com/solutions/ai-in-self-driving). Track mode implements sophisticated algorithms like ByteTrack to maintain object identity across frames, even when objects temporarily disappear from view.

[Track Examples](track.md){ .md-button }

## [Benchmark](benchmark.md)

Benchmark mode profiles the speed and accuracy of various export formats for YOLO11. This mode provides comprehensive metrics on model size, accuracy (mAP50-95 for detection tasks or accuracy_top5 for classification), and inference time across different formats like ONNX, [OpenVINO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/openvino/), and TensorRT. Benchmarking helps you select the optimal export format based on your specific requirements for speed and accuracy in your deployment environment.

## FAQ

### How do I train a custom [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) model with Ultralytics YOLO11?

Training a custom object detection model with Ultralytics YOLO11 involves using the train mode. You need a dataset formatted in YOLO format, containing images and corresponding annotation files. Use the following command to start the training process:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pre-trained YOLO model (you can choose n, s, m, l, or x versions)
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Start training on your custom dataset
        model.train(data="path/to/dataset.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Train a YOLO model from the command line
        yolo train data=path/to/dataset.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=640
        ```

For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the [Ultralytics Train Guide](../modes/train.md).

### What metrics does Ultralytics YOLO11 use to validate the model's performance?

Ultralytics YOLO11 uses various metrics during the validation process to assess model performance. These include:

- **mAP (mean Average Precision)**: This evaluates the accuracy of object detection.
- **IOU (Intersection over Union)**: Measures the overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes.
- **[Precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/precision) and [Recall](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/recall)**: Precision measures the ratio of true positive detections to the total detected positives, while recall measures the ratio of true positive detections to the total actual positives.

You can run the following command to start the validation:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pre-trained or custom YOLO model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Run validation on your dataset
        model.val(data="path/to/validation.yaml")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Validate a YOLO model from the command line

## Usage Examples

Export a YOLO11n model to a different format like ONNX or TensorRT. See the Arguments section below for a full list of export arguments.

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")  # load an official model
        model = YOLO("path/to/best.pt")  # load a custom trained model

        # Export the model
        model.export(format="onnx")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo export model=yolo11n.pt format=onnx  # export official model
        yolo export model=path/to/best.pt format=onnx  # export custom trained model
        ```

## Arguments

This table details the configurations and options available for exporting YOLO models to different formats. These settings are critical for optimizing the exported model's performance, size, and compatibility across various platforms and environments. Proper configuration ensures that the model is ready for deployment in the intended application with optimal efficiency.

{% include "macros/export-args.md" %}

Adjusting these parameters allows for customization of the export process to fit specific requirements, such as deployment environment, hardware constraints, and performance targets. Selecting the appropriate format and settings is essential for achieving the best balance between model size, speed, and [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy).

## Export Formats

Available YOLO11 export formats are in the table below. You can export to any format using the `format` argument, i.e. `format='onnx'` or `format='engine'`. You can predict or validate directly on exported models, i.e. `yolo predict model=yolo11n.onnx`. Usage examples are shown for your model after export completes.

## FAQ

### How do I export a YOLO11 model to ONNX format?

Exporting a YOLO11 model to ONNX format is straightforward with Ultralytics. It provides both Python and CLI methods for exporting models.

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")  # load an official model
        model = YOLO("path/to/best.pt")  # load a custom trained model

        # Export the model
        model.export(format="onnx")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo export model=yolo11n.pt format=onnx  # export official model
        yolo export model=path/to/best.pt format=onnx  # export custom trained model
        ```

For more details on the process, including advanced options like handling different input sizes, refer to the [ONNX integration guide](../integrations/onnx.md).

### What are the benefits of using TensorRT for model export?

Using TensorRT for model export offers significant performance improvements. YOLO11 models exported to TensorRT can achieve up to a 5x GPU speedup, making it ideal for real-time inference applications.

- **Versatility:** Optimize models for a specific hardware setup.
- **Speed:** Achieve faster inference through advanced optimizations.
- **Compatibility:** Integrate smoothly with NVIDIA hardware.

To learn more about integrating TensorRT, see the [TensorRT integration guide](../integrations/tensorrt.md).

### How do I enable INT8 quantization when exporting my YOLO11 model?

INT8 quantization is an excellent way to compress the model and speed up inference, especially on edge devices. Here's how you can enable INT8 quantization:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")  # Load a model
        model.export(format="engine", int8=True)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo export model=yolo11n.pt format=engine int8=True   # export TensorRT model with INT8 quantization
        ```

INT8 quantization can be applied to various formats, such as [TensorRT](../integrations/tensorrt.md), [OpenVINO](../integrations/openvino.md), and [CoreML](../integrations/coreml.md). For optimal quantization results, provide a representative [dataset](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/) using the `data` parameter.

### Why is dynamic input size important when exporting models?

Dynamic input size allows the exported model to handle varying image dimensions, providing flexibility and optimizing processing efficiency for different use cases. When exporting to formats like [ONNX](../integrations/onnx.md) or [TensorRT](../integrations/tensorrt.md), enabling dynamic input size ensures that the model can adapt to different input shapes seamlessly.

To enable this feature, use the `dynamic=True` flag during export:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")
        model.export(format="onnx", dynamic=True)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo export model=yolo11n.pt format=onnx dynamic=True
        ```

Dynamic input sizing is particularly useful for applications where input dimensions may vary, such as video processing or when handling images from different sources.

### What are the key export arguments to consider for optimizing model performance?

Understanding and configuring export arguments is crucial for optimizing model performance:

- **`format:`** The target format for the exported model (e.g., `onnx`, `torchscript`, `tensorflow`).
- **`imgsz:`** Desired image size for the model input (e.g., `640` or `(height, width)`).
- **`half:`** Enables FP16 quantization, reducing model size and potentially speeding up inference.
- **`optimize:`** Applies specific optimizations for mobile or constrained environments.
- **`int8:`** Enables INT8 quantization, highly beneficial for [edge AI](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/deploying-computer-vision-applications-on-edge-ai-devices) deployments.

For deployment on specific hardware platforms, consider using specialized export formats like [TensorRT](../integrations/tensorrt.md) for NVIDIA GPUs, [CoreML](../integrations/coreml.md) for Apple devices, or [Edge TPU](../integrations/edge-tpu.md) for Google Coral devices.

Deploying [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) models on edge devices or embedded devices requires a format that can ensure seamless performance.

The TensorFlow Lite or TFLite export format allows you to optimize your [Ultralytics YOLO11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) models for tasks like [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) and [image classification](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/image-classification) in edge device-based applications. In this guide, we'll walk through the steps for converting your models to the TFLite format, making it easier for your models to perform well on various edge devices.

## Why should you export to TFLite?

Introduced by Google in May 2017 as part of their TensorFlow framework, [TensorFlow Lite](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert), or TFLite for short, is an open-source deep learning framework designed for on-device inference, also known as edge computing. It gives developers the necessary tools to execute their trained models on mobile, embedded, and IoT devices, as well as traditional computers.

TensorFlow Lite is compatible with a wide range of platforms, including embedded Linux, Android, iOS, and MCU. Exporting your model to TFLite makes your applications faster, more reliable, and capable of running offline.

## Key Features of TFLite Models

TFLite models offer a wide range of key features that enable on-device machine learning by helping developers run their models on mobile, embedded, and edge devices:

- **On-device Optimization**: TFLite optimizes for on-device ML, reducing latency by processing data locally, enhancing privacy by not transmitting personal data, and minimizing model size to save space.

- **Multiple Platform Support**: TFLite offers extensive platform compatibility, supporting Android, iOS, embedded Linux, and microcontrollers.

- **Diverse Language Support**: TFLite is compatible with various programming languages, including Java, Swift, Objective-C, C++, and Python.

- **High Performance**: Achieves superior performance through hardware acceleration and model optimization.

## Deployment Options in TFLite

Before we look at the code for exporting YOLO11 models to the TFLite format, let's understand how TFLite models are normally used.

TFLite offers various on-device deployment options for machine learning models, including:

- **Deploying with Android and iOS**: Both Android and iOS applications with TFLite can analyze edge-based camera feeds and sensors to detect and identify objects. TFLite also offers native iOS libraries written in [Swift](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/swift) and [Objective-C](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/objc). The architecture diagram below shows the process of deploying a trained model onto Android and iOS platforms using TensorFlow Lite.

</p>

- **Implementing with Embedded Linux**: If running inferences on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) using the [Ultralytics Guide](../guides/raspberry-pi.md) does not meet the speed requirements for your use case, you can use an exported TFLite model to accelerate inference times. Additionally, it's possible to further improve performance by utilizing a [Coral Edge TPU device](https://coral.withgoogle.com/).

- **Deploying with Microcontrollers**: TFLite models can also be deployed on microcontrollers and other devices with only a few kilobytes of memory. The core runtime just fits in 16 KB on an Arm Cortex M3 and can run many basic models. It doesn't require operating system support, any standard C or C++ libraries, or dynamic memory allocation.

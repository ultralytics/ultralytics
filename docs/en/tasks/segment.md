# Instance Segmentation

<img width="1024" src="https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/instance-segmentation-examples.avif" alt="Instance segmentation examples">

[Instance segmentation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/instance-segmentation) goes a step further than object detection and involves identifying individual objects in an image and segmenting them from the rest of the image.

The output of an instance segmentation model is a set of masks or contours that outline each object in the image, along with class labels and confidence scores for each object. Instance segmentation is useful when you need to know not only where objects are in an image, but also what their exact shape is.

!!! tip

    YOLO11 Segment models use the `-seg` suffix, i.e. `yolo11n-seg.pt` and are pretrained on [COCO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/coco.yaml).

## [Models](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/tree/main/ultralytics/cfg/models/11)

YOLO11 pretrained Segment models are shown here. Detect, Segment and Pose models are pretrained on the [COCO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/coco.yaml) dataset, while Classify models are pretrained on the [ImageNet](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/ImageNet.yaml) dataset.

[Models](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/tree/main/ultralytics/cfg/models) download automatically from the latest Ultralytics [release](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases) on first use.

### Dataset format

YOLO segmentation dataset format can be found in detail in the [Dataset Guide](../datasets/segment/index.md). To convert your existing dataset from other formats (like COCO etc.) to YOLO format, please use [JSON2YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/JSON2YOLO) tool by Ultralytics.

## Val

Validate trained YOLO11n-seg model [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy) on the COCO8-seg dataset. No arguments are needed as the `model` retains its training `data` and arguments as model attributes.

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n-seg.pt")  # load an official model
        model = YOLO("path/to/best.pt")  # load a custom model

        # Validate the model
        metrics = model.val()  # no arguments needed, dataset and settings remembered
        metrics.box.map  # map50-95(B)
        metrics.box.map50  # map50(B)
        metrics.box.map75  # map75(B)
        metrics.box.maps  # a list contains map50-95(B) of each category
        metrics.seg.map  # map50-95(M)
        metrics.seg.map50  # map50(M)
        metrics.seg.map75  # map75(M)
        metrics.seg.maps  # a list contains map50-95(M) of each category
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo segment val model=yolo11n-seg.pt  # val official model
        yolo segment val model=path/to/best.pt  # val custom model
        ```

## Predict

Use a trained YOLO11n-seg model to run predictions on images.

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n-seg.pt")  # load an official model
        model = YOLO("path/to/best.pt")  # load a custom model

        # Predict with the model
        results = model("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")  # predict on an image
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo segment predict model=yolo11n-seg.pt source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg'  # predict with official model
        yolo segment predict model=path/to/best.pt source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg'  # predict with custom model
        ```

See full `predict` mode details in the [Predict](../modes/predict.md) page.

## Export

Export a YOLO11n-seg model to a different format like ONNX, CoreML, etc.

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n-seg.pt")  # load an official model
        model = YOLO("path/to/best.pt")  # load a custom trained model

        # Export the model
        model.export(format="onnx")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo export model=yolo11n-seg.pt format=onnx  # export official model
        yolo export model=path/to/best.pt format=onnx  # export custom trained model
        ```

Available YOLO11-seg export formats are in the table below. You can export to any format using the `format` argument, i.e. `format='onnx'` or `format='engine'`. You can predict or validate directly on exported models, i.e. `yolo predict model=yolo11n-seg.onnx`. Usage examples are shown for your model after export completes.

## FAQ

### How do I train a YOLO11 segmentation model on a custom dataset?

To train a YOLO11 segmentation model on a custom dataset, you first need to prepare your dataset in the YOLO segmentation format. You can use tools like [JSON2YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/JSON2YOLO) to convert datasets from other formats. Once your dataset is ready, you can train the model using Python or CLI commands:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pretrained YOLO11 segment model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n-seg.pt")

        # Train the model
        results = model.train(data="path/to/your_dataset.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo segment train data=path/to/your_dataset.yaml model=yolo11n-seg.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640
        ```

Check the [Configuration](../usage/cfg.md) page for more available arguments.

### What is the difference between [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) and instance segmentation in YOLO11?

Object detection identifies and localizes objects within an image by drawing bounding boxes around them, whereas instance segmentation not only identifies the bounding boxes but also delineates the exact shape of each object. YOLO11 instance segmentation models provide masks or contours that outline each detected object, which is particularly useful for tasks where knowing the precise shape of objects is important, such as medical imaging or autonomous driving.

### Why use YOLO11 for instance segmentation?

Ultralytics YOLO11 is a state-of-the-art model recognized for its high accuracy and real-time performance, making it ideal for instance segmentation tasks. YOLO11 Segment models come pretrained on the [COCO dataset](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/coco.yaml), ensuring robust performance across a variety of objects. Additionally, YOLO supports training, validation, prediction, and export functionalities with seamless integration, making it highly versatile for both research and industry applications.

### How do I load and validate a pretrained YOLO segmentation model?

Loading and validating a pretrained YOLO segmentation model is straightforward. Here's how you can do it using both Python and CLI:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pretrained model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n-seg.pt")

        # Validate the model
        metrics = model.val()
        print("Mean Average Precision for boxes:", metrics.box.map)
        print("Mean Average Precision for masks:", metrics.seg.map)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo segment val model=yolo11n-seg.pt
        ```

These steps will provide you with validation metrics like [Mean Average Precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/mean-average-precision-map) (mAP), crucial for assessing model performance.

### How can I export a YOLO segmentation model to ONNX format?

Exporting a YOLO segmentation model to ONNX format is simple and can be done using Python or CLI commands:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pretrained model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n-seg.pt")

        # Export the model to ONNX format
        model.export(format="onnx")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo export model=yolo11n-seg.pt format=onnx
        ```

For more details on exporting to various formats, refer to the [Export](../modes/export.md) page.

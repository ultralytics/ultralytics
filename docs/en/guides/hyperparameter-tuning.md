# Ultralytics YOLO [Hyperparameter Tuning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/hyperparameter-tuning) Guide

## Introduction

Hyperparameter tuning is not just a one-time set-up but an iterative process aimed at optimizing the [machine learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml) model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall. In the context of Ultralytics YOLO, these hyperparameters could range from learning rate to architectural details, such as the number of layers or types of activation functions used.

### What are Hyperparameters?

Hyperparameters are high-level, structural settings for the algorithm. They are set prior to the training phase and remain constant during it. Here are some commonly tuned hyperparameters in Ultralytics YOLO:

- **Learning Rate** `lr0`: Determines the step size at each iteration while moving towards a minimum in the [loss function](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/loss-function).
- **[Batch Size](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/batch-size)** `batch`: Number of images processed simultaneously in a forward pass.
- **Number of [Epochs](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/epoch)** `epochs`: An epoch is one complete forward and backward pass of all the training examples.
- **Architecture Specifics**: Such as channel counts, number of layers, types of activation functions, etc.

For a full list of augmentation hyperparameters used in YOLO11 please refer to the [configurations page](../usage/cfg.md#augmentation-settings).

### Genetic Evolution and Mutation

Ultralytics YOLO uses genetic algorithms to optimize hyperparameters. Genetic algorithms are inspired by the mechanism of natural selection and genetics.

- **Mutation**: In the context of Ultralytics YOLO, mutation helps in locally searching the hyperparameter space by applying small, random changes to existing hyperparameters, producing new candidates for evaluation.
- **Crossover**: Although crossover is a popular genetic algorithm technique, it is not currently used in Ultralytics YOLO for hyperparameter tuning. The focus is mainly on mutation for generating new hyperparameter sets.

## Preparing for Hyperparameter Tuning

Before you begin the tuning process, it's important to:

1. **Identify the Metrics**: Determine the metrics you will use to evaluate the model's performance. This could be AP50, F1-score, or others.
2. **Set the Tuning Budget**: Define how much computational resources you're willing to allocate. Hyperparameter tuning can be computationally intensive.

## Steps Involved

### Initialize Hyperparameters

Start with a reasonable set of initial hyperparameters. This could either be the default hyperparameters set by Ultralytics YOLO or something based on your domain knowledge or previous experiments.

### Mutate Hyperparameters

Use the `_mutate` method to produce a new set of hyperparameters based on the existing set.

### Train Model

Training is performed using the mutated set of hyperparameters. The training performance is then assessed.

### Evaluate Model

Use metrics like AP50, F1-score, or custom metrics to evaluate the model's performance.

### Log Results

It's crucial to log both the performance metrics and the corresponding hyperparameters for future reference.

### Repeat

The process is repeated until either the set number of iterations is reached or the performance metric is satisfactory.

## Default Search Space Description

The following table lists the default search space parameters for hyperparameter tuning in YOLO11. Each parameter has a specific value range defined by a tuple `(min, max)`.

| Parameter         | Type    | Value Range    | Description                                                                                                      |

| `perspective`     | `float` | `(0.0, 0.001)` | Random perspective augmentation range. Simulates different viewing angles                                        |
| `flipud`          | `float` | `(0.0, 1.0)`   | Probability of vertical image flip during training. Useful for overhead/aerial imagery                           |

## Custom Search Space Example

Here's how to define a search space and use the `model.tune()` method to utilize the `Tuner` class for hyperparameter tuning of YOLO11n on COCO8 for 30 epochs with an AdamW optimizer and skipping plotting, checkpointing and validation other than on final epoch for faster Tuning.

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Initialize the YOLO model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Define search space
        search_space = {
            "lr0": (1e-5, 1e-1),
            "degrees": (0.0, 45.0),
        }

        # Tune hyperparameters on COCO8 for 30 epochs
        model.tune(
            data="coco8.yaml",
            epochs=30,
            iterations=300,
            optimizer="AdamW",
            space=search_space,
            plots=False,
            save=False,
            val=False,
        )
        ```

## Results

After you've successfully completed the hyperparameter tuning process, you will obtain several files and directories that encapsulate the results of the tuning. The following describes each:

## FAQ

### How do I optimize the [learning rate](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/learning-rate) for Ultralytics YOLO during hyperparameter tuning?

To optimize the learning rate for Ultralytics YOLO, start by setting an initial learning rate using the `lr0` parameter. Common values range from `0.001` to `0.01`. During the hyperparameter tuning process, this value will be mutated to find the optimal setting. You can utilize the `model.tune()` method to automate this process. For example:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Initialize the YOLO model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Tune hyperparameters on COCO8 for 30 epochs
        model.tune(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=30, iterations=300, optimizer="AdamW", plots=False, save=False, val=False)
        ```

For more details, check the [Ultralytics YOLO configuration page](../usage/cfg.md#augmentation-settings).

### What are the benefits of using genetic algorithms for hyperparameter tuning in YOLO11?

Genetic algorithms in Ultralytics YOLO11 provide a robust method for exploring the hyperparameter space, leading to highly optimized model performance. Key benefits include:

- **Efficient Search**: Genetic algorithms like mutation can quickly explore a large set of hyperparameters.
- **Avoiding Local Minima**: By introducing randomness, they help in avoiding local minima, ensuring better global optimization.
- **Performance Metrics**: They adapt based on performance metrics such as AP50 and F1-score.

To see how genetic algorithms can optimize hyperparameters, check out the [hyperparameter evolution guide](../yolov5/tutorials/hyperparameter_evolution.md).

### How long does the hyperparameter tuning process take for Ultralytics YOLO?

The time required for hyperparameter tuning with Ultralytics YOLO largely depends on several factors such as the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model architecture, the number of iterations, and the computational resources available. For instance, tuning YOLO11n on a dataset like COCO8 for 30 epochs might take several hours to days, depending on the hardware.

To effectively manage tuning time, define a clear tuning budget beforehand ([internal section link](#preparing-for-hyperparameter-tuning)). This helps in balancing resource allocation and optimization goals.

### What metrics should I use to evaluate model performance during hyperparameter tuning in YOLO?

When evaluating model performance during hyperparameter tuning in YOLO, you can use several key metrics:

- **AP50**: The average precision at IoU threshold of 0.50.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Precision and Recall**: Individual metrics indicating the model's [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy) in identifying true positives versus false positives and false negatives.

These metrics help you understand different aspects of your model's performance. Refer to the [Ultralytics YOLO performance metrics](../guides/yolo-performance-metrics.md) guide for a comprehensive overview.

### Can I use Ultralytics HUB for hyperparameter tuning of YOLO models?

Yes, you can use Ultralytics HUB for hyperparameter tuning of YOLO models. The HUB offers a no-code platform to easily upload datasets, train models, and perform hyperparameter tuning efficiently. It provides real-time tracking and visualization of tuning progress and results.

Explore more about using Ultralytics HUB for hyperparameter tuning in the [Ultralytics HUB Cloud Training](../hub/cloud-training.md) documentation.

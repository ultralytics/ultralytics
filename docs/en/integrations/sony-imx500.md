## Why Should You Export to IMX500

Sony's [IMX500 Intelligent Vision Sensor](https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/raspberrypi-ai-camera) is a game-changing piece of hardware in edge AI processing. It's the world's first intelligent vision sensor with on-chip AI capabilities. This sensor helps overcome many challenges in edge AI, including data processing bottlenecks, privacy concerns, and performance limitations.  
While other sensors merely pass along images and frames, the IMX500 tells a whole story. It processes data directly on the sensor, allowing devices to generate insights in real-time.

## Sony's IMX500 Export for YOLOv8 Models

The IMX500 is designed to transform how devices handle data directly on the sensor, without needing to send it off to the cloud for processing.

The IMX500 works with quantized models. Quantization makes models smaller and faster without losing much [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy). It is ideal for the limited resources of edge computing, allowing applications to respond quickly by reducing latency and allowing for quick data processing locally, without cloud dependency. Local processing also keeps user data private and secure since it's not sent to a remote server.

**IMX500 Key Features:**

- **Metadata Output:** Instead of transmitting full images, the IMX500 outputs only metadata, minimizing data size, reducing bandwidth, and lowering costs.
- **Addresses Privacy Concerns:** By processing data on the device, the IMX500 addresses privacy concerns, ideal for human-centric applications like person counting and occupancy tracking.
- **Real-time Processing:** Fast, on-sensor processing supports real-time decisions, perfect for edge AI applications such as autonomous systems.

**Before You Begin:** For best results, ensure your YOLOv8 model is well-prepared for export by following our [Model Training Guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/), [Data Preparation Guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/), and [Hyperparameter Tuning Guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/hyperparameter-tuning/).

## Usage Examples

Export an Ultralytics YOLOv8 model to IMX500 format and run inference with the exported model.

!!! note

    Here we perform inference just to make sure the model works as expected. However, for deployment and inference on the Raspberry Pi AI Camera, please jump to [Using IMX500 Export in Deployment](#using-imx500-export-in-deployment) section.

!!! example

    === "Python"

         ```python
         from ultralytics import YOLO

         # Load a YOLOv8n PyTorch model
         model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

         # Export the model
         model.export(format="imx")  # exports with PTQ quantization by default

         # Load the exported model
         imx_model = YOLO("yolov8n_imx_model")

         # Run inference
         results = imx_model("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")
         ```

    === "CLI"

         ```bash
         # Export a YOLOv8n PyTorch model to imx format with Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)
         yolo export model=yolov8n.pt format=imx

         # Run inference with the exported model
         yolo predict model=yolov8n_imx_model source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg'
         ```

The export process will create an ONNX model for quantization validation, along with a directory named `<model-name>_imx_model`. This directory will include the `packerOut.zip` file, which is essential for packaging the model for deployment on the IMX500 hardware. Additionally, the `<model-name>_imx_model` folder will contain a text file (`labels.txt`) listing all the labels associated with the model.

```bash
yolov8n_imx_model
├── dnnParams.xml
├── labels.txt
├── packerOut.zip
├── yolov8n_imx.onnx
├── yolov8n_imx500_model_MemoryReport.json
└── yolov8n_imx500_model.pbtxt
```

## Arguments

When exporting a model to IMX500 format, you can specify various arguments:

| Key      | Value  | Description                                              |
| -------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `format` | `imx`  | Format to export to (imx)                                |

sudo apt install python3-opencv python3-munkres
```

Step 4: Reboot Raspberry Pi for the changes to take into effect

```bash
sudo reboot
```

### Package Model and Deploy to AI Camera

After obtaining `packerOut.zip` from the IMX500 conversion process, you can pass this file into the packager tool to obtain an RPK file. This file can then be deployed directly to the AI Camera using `picamera2`.

Step 1: Package the model into RPK file

```bash
imx500-package -i <path to packerOut.zip> -o <output folder>
```

The above will generate a `network.rpk` file inside the specified output folder.

Step 2: Clone `picamera2` repository, install it and navigate to the imx500 examples

```bash
git clone -b next https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2
cd picamera2
pip install -e .  --break-system-packages
cd examples/imx500
```

Step 3: Run YOLOv8 object detection, using the labels.txt file that has been generated during the IMX500 export.

```bash
python imx500_object_detection_demo.py --model <path to network.rpk> --fps 25 --bbox-normalization --ignore-dash-labels --bbox-order xy –labels <path to labels.txt>
```

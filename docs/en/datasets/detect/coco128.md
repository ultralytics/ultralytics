# COCO128 Dataset

## Introduction

[Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) COCO128 is a small, but versatile [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) dataset composed of the first 128 images of the COCO train 2017 set. This dataset is ideal for testing and debugging object detection models, or for experimenting with new detection approaches. With 128 images, it is small enough to be easily manageable, yet diverse enough to test training pipelines for errors and act as a sanity check before training larger datasets.

This dataset is intended for use with Ultralytics [HUB](https://hub.ultralytics.com/) and [YOLO11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).

## Dataset YAML

A YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) file is used to define the dataset configuration. It contains information about the dataset's paths, classes, and other relevant information. In the case of the COCO128 dataset, the `coco128.yaml` file is maintained at [https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/coco128.yaml](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/coco128.yaml).

!!! example "ultralytics/cfg/datasets/coco128.yaml"

    ```yaml
    --8<-- "ultralytics/cfg/datasets/coco128.yaml"
    ```

## Usage

To train a YOLO11n model on the COCO128 dataset for 100 [epochs](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/epoch) with an image size of 640, you can use the following code snippets. For a comprehensive list of available arguments, refer to the model [Training](../../modes/train.md) page.

!!! example "Train Example"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)

        # Train the model
        results = model.train(data="coco128.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Start training from a pretrained *.pt model
        yolo detect train data=coco128.yaml model=yolo11n.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640
        ```

## Sample Images and Annotations

Here are some examples of images from the COCO128 dataset, along with their corresponding annotations:

- **Mosaiced Image**: This image demonstrates a training batch composed of mosaiced dataset images. Mosaicing is a technique used during training that combines multiple images into a single image to increase the variety of objects and scenes within each training batch. This helps improve the model's ability to generalize to different object sizes, aspect ratios, and contexts.

The example showcases the variety and complexity of the images in the COCO128 dataset and the benefits of using mosaicing during the training process.

    <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: -20px;">![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/ultralytics?logo=python&logoColor=gold)<p>

    === "Pip install (recommended)"

        Install or update the `ultralytics` package using pip by running `pip install -U ultralytics`. For more details on the `ultralytics` package, visit the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/).

        [![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ultralytics?logo=pypi&logoColor=white)](https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/)
        [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/ultralytics)](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/ultralytics)

        ```bash
        # Install the ultralytics package from PyPI
        pip install ultralytics
        ```

        You can also install `ultralytics` directly from the [Ultralytics GitHub repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). This can be useful if you want the latest development version. Ensure you have the Git command-line tool installed, and then run:

        ```bash
        # Install the ultralytics package from GitHub
        pip install git+https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics.git@main
        ```

    === "Conda install"

        Conda can be used as an alternative package manager to pip. For more details, visit [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ultralytics). The Ultralytics feedstock repository for updating the conda package is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/conda-forge/ultralytics-feedstock/).

        [![Conda Version](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/ultralytics?logo=condaforge)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ultralytics)
        [![Conda Downloads](https://img.shields.io/conda/dn/conda-forge/ultralytics.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ultralytics)
        [![Conda Recipe](https://img.shields.io/badge/recipe-ultralytics-green.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ultralytics)
        [![Conda Platforms](https://img.shields.io/conda/pn/conda-forge/ultralytics.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ultralytics)

        ```bash
        # Install the ultralytics package using conda
        conda install -c conda-forge ultralytics
        ```

        !!! note

            If you are installing in a CUDA environment, it is best practice to install `ultralytics`, `pytorch`, and `pytorch-cuda` in the same command. This allows the conda package manager to resolve any conflicts. Alternatively, install `pytorch-cuda` last to override the CPU-specific `pytorch` package if necessary.
            ```bash
            # Install all packages together using conda
            conda install -c pytorch -c nvidia -c conda-forge pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.8 ultralytics
            ```

        ### Conda Docker Image

        Ultralytics Conda Docker images are also available from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/ultralytics). These images are based on [Miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) and provide a straightforward way to start using `ultralytics` in a Conda environment.

        ```bash
        # Set image name as a variable
        t=ultralytics/ultralytics:latest-conda

        # Pull the latest ultralytics image from Docker Hub
        sudo docker pull $t

        # Run the ultralytics image in a container with GPU support
        sudo docker run -it --ipc=host --gpus all $t  # all GPUs
        sudo docker run -it --ipc=host --gpus '"device=2,3"' $t  # specify GPUs
        ```

    === "Git clone"

        Clone the [Ultralytics GitHub repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) if you are interested in contributing to development or wish to experiment with the latest source code. After cloning, navigate into the directory and install the package in editable mode `-e` using pip.

        [![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/ultralytics/ultralytics?logo=github)](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
        [![GitHub commit activity](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/t/ultralytics/ultralytics)](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)

        ```bash
        # Clone the ultralytics repository
        git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics

        # Navigate to the cloned directory
        cd ultralytics

        # Install the package in editable mode for development
        pip install -e .
        ```

    === "Docker"

        Use Docker to execute the `ultralytics` package in an isolated container, ensuring consistent performance across various environments. By selecting one of the official `ultralytics` images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/ultralytics), you avoid the complexity of local installation and gain access to a verified working environment. Ultralytics offers five main supported Docker images, each designed for high compatibility and efficiency:

        [![Docker Image Version](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/ultralytics/ultralytics?sort=semver&logo=docker)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/ultralytics)
        [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/ultralytics/ultralytics)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/ultralytics)

        - **Dockerfile:** GPU image recommended for training.
        - **Dockerfile-arm64:** Optimized for ARM64 architecture, suitable for deployment on devices like Raspberry Pi and other ARM64-based platforms.
        - **Dockerfile-cpu:** Ubuntu-based CPU-only version, suitable for inference and environments without GPUs.
        - **Dockerfile-jetson:** Tailored for [NVIDIA Jetson](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/nvidia-jetson/) devices, integrating GPU support optimized for these platforms.
        - **Dockerfile-python:** Minimal image with just Python and necessary dependencies, ideal for lightweight applications and development.
        - **Dockerfile-conda:** Based on Miniconda3 with a conda installation of the `ultralytics` package.

        Here are the commands to get the latest image and execute it:

        ```bash
        # Set image name as a variable
        t=ultralytics/ultralytics:latest

        # Pull the latest ultralytics image from Docker Hub
        sudo docker pull $t

        # Run the ultralytics image in a container with GPU support
        sudo docker run -it --ipc=host --gpus all $t  # all GPUs
        sudo docker run -it --ipc=host --gpus '"device=2,3"' $t  # specify GPUs
        ```

        The above command initializes a Docker container with the latest `ultralytics` image. The `-it` flags assign a pseudo-TTY and keep stdin open, allowing interaction with the container. The `--ipc=host` flag sets the IPC (Inter-Process Communication) namespace to the host, which is essential for sharing memory between processes. The `--gpus all` flag enables access to all available GPUs inside the container, crucial for tasks requiring GPU computation.

        Note: To work with files on your local machine within the container, use Docker volumes to mount a local directory into the container:

        ```bash
        # Mount local directory to a directory inside the container
        sudo docker run -it --ipc=host --gpus all -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container $t
        ```

        Replace `/path/on/host` with the directory path on your local machine, and `/path/in/container` with the desired path inside the Docker container.

        For advanced Docker usage, explore the [Ultralytics Docker Guide](guides/docker-quickstart.md).

See the `ultralytics` [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/pyproject.toml) file for a list of dependencies. Note that all examples above install all required dependencies.

## Use Ultralytics with CLI

The Ultralytics command-line interface (CLI) allows for simple single-line commands without needing a Python environment. CLI requires no customization or Python code; run all tasks from the terminal with the `yolo` command. For more on using YOLO from the command line, see the [CLI Guide](usage/cli.md).

!!! example

    === "Syntax"

        Ultralytics `yolo` commands use the following syntax:
        ```bash
        yolo TASK MODE ARGS
        ```
        - `TASK` (optional) is one of ([detect](tasks/detect.md), [segment](tasks/segment.md), [classify](tasks/classify.md), [pose](tasks/pose.md), [obb](tasks/obb.md))
        - `MODE` (required) is one of ([train](modes/train.md), [val](modes/val.md), [predict](modes/predict.md), [export](modes/export.md), [track](modes/track.md), [benchmark](modes/benchmark.md))
        - `ARGS` (optional) are `arg=value` pairs like `imgsz=640` that override defaults.

        See all `ARGS` in the full [Configuration Guide](usage/cfg.md) or with the `yolo cfg` CLI command.

    === "Train"

        Train a detection model for 10 [epochs](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/epoch) with an initial learning rate of 0.01:
        ```bash
        yolo train data=coco8.yaml model=yolo11n.pt epochs=10 lr0=0.01
        ```

    === "Predict"

        Predict a YouTube video using a pretrained segmentation model at image size 320:
        ```bash
        yolo predict model=yolo11n-seg.pt source='https://youtu.be/LNwODJXcvt4' imgsz=320
        ```

    === "Val"

        Validate a pretrained detection model with a batch size of 1 and image size of 640:

## Use Ultralytics with Python

The Ultralytics YOLO Python interface offers seamless integration into Python projects, making it easy to load, run, and process model outputs. Designed for simplicity, the Python interface allows users to quickly implement [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection), segmentation, and classification. This makes the YOLO Python interface an invaluable tool for incorporating these functionalities into Python projects.

For instance, users can load a model, train it, evaluate its performance, and export it to ONNX format with just a few lines of code. Explore the [Python Guide](usage/python.md) to learn more about using YOLO within your Python projects.

!!! example

    ```python
    from ultralytics import YOLO

    # Create a new YOLO model from scratch
    model = YOLO("yolo11n.yaml")

    # Load a pretrained YOLO model (recommended for training)
    model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

    # Train the model using the 'coco8.yaml' dataset for 3 epochs
    results = model.train(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=3)

    # Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set
    results = model.val()

    # Perform object detection on an image using the model
    results = model("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")

    # Export the model to ONNX format
    success = model.export(format="onnx")
    ```

## Ultralytics Settings

The Ultralytics library includes a `SettingsManager` for fine-grained control over experiments, allowing users to access and modify settings easily. Stored in a JSON file within the environment's user configuration directory, these settings can be viewed or modified in the Python environment or via the Command-Line Interface (CLI).

### Inspecting Settings

To view the current configuration of your settings:

!!! example "View settings"

    === "Python"

        Use Python to view your settings by importing the `settings` object from the `ultralytics` module. Print and return settings with these commands:
        ```python
        from ultralytics import settings

        # View all settings
        print(settings)

        # Return a specific setting
        value = settings["runs_dir"]
        ```

    === "CLI"

        The command-line interface allows you to check your settings with:
        ```bash
        yolo settings
        ```

### Modifying Settings

Ultralytics makes it easy to modify settings in the following ways:

!!! example "Update settings"

    === "Python"

        In Python, use the `update` method on the `settings` object:
        ```python
        from ultralytics import settings

        # Update a setting
        settings.update({"runs_dir": "/path/to/runs"})

        # Update multiple settings
        settings.update({"runs_dir": "/path/to/runs", "tensorboard": False})

        # Reset settings to default values
        settings.reset()
        ```

    === "CLI"

        To modify settings using the command-line interface:
        ```bash
        # Update a setting
        yolo settings runs_dir='/path/to/runs'

        # Update multiple settings
        yolo settings runs_dir='/path/to/runs' tensorboard=False

        # Reset settings to default values
        yolo settings reset
        ```

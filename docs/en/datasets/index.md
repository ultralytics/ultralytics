## Contribute New Datasets

Contributing a new dataset involves several steps to ensure that it aligns well with the existing infrastructure. Below are the necessary steps:

### Steps to Contribute a New Dataset

1. **Collect Images**: Gather the images that belong to the dataset. These could be collected from various sources, such as public databases or your own collection.
2. **Annotate Images**: Annotate these images with bounding boxes, segments, or keypoints, depending on the task.
3. **Export Annotations**: Convert these annotations into the YOLO `*.txt` file format which Ultralytics supports.
4. **Organize Dataset**: Arrange your dataset into the correct folder structure. You should have `train/` and `val/` top-level directories, and within each, an `images/` and `labels/` subdirectory.

    ```
    dataset/
    ├── train/
    │   ├── images/
    │   └── labels/
    └── val/
        ├── images/
        └── labels/
    ```

5. **Create a `data.yaml` File**: In your dataset's root directory, create a `data.yaml` file that describes the dataset, classes, and other necessary information.
6. **Optimize Images (Optional)**: If you want to reduce the size of the dataset for more efficient processing, you can optimize the images using the code below. This is not required, but recommended for smaller dataset sizes and faster download speeds.
7. **Zip Dataset**: Compress the entire dataset folder into a zip file.
8. **Document and PR**: Create a documentation page describing your dataset and how it fits into the existing framework. After that, submit a Pull Request (PR). Refer to [Ultralytics Contribution Guidelines](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/contributing/) for more details on how to submit a PR.

### Example Code to Optimize and Zip a Dataset

!!! example "Optimize and Zip a Dataset"

    === "Python"

       ```python
       from pathlib import Path

       from ultralytics.data.utils import compress_one_image
       from ultralytics.utils.downloads import zip_directory

       # Define dataset directory
       path = Path("path/to/dataset")

       # Optimize images in dataset (optional)
       for f in path.rglob("*.jpg"):
           compress_one_image(f)

       # Zip dataset into 'path/to/dataset.zip'
       zip_directory(path)
       ```

By following these steps, you can contribute a new dataset that integrates well with Ultralytics' existing structure.

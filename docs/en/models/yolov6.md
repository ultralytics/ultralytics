# Meituan YOLOv6

## Overview

[Meituan](https://www.meituan.com/) YOLOv6 is a cutting-edge object detector that offers remarkable balance between speed and accuracy, making it a popular choice for real-time applications. This model introduces several notable enhancements on its architecture and training scheme, including the implementation of a Bi-directional Concatenation (BiC) module, an anchor-aided training (AAT) strategy, and an improved backbone and neck design for state-of-the-art accuracy on the COCO dataset.

### Key Features

- **Bidirectional Concatenation (BiC) Module:** YOLOv6 introduces a BiC module in the neck of the detector, enhancing localization signals and delivering performance gains with negligible speed degradation.
- **Anchor-Aided Training (AAT) Strategy:** This model proposes AAT to enjoy the benefits of both anchor-based and anchor-free paradigms without compromising inference efficiency.
- **Enhanced Backbone and Neck Design:** By deepening YOLOv6 to include another stage in the backbone and neck, this model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COCO dataset at high-resolution input.
- **Self-Distillation Strategy:** A new self-distillation strategy is implemented to boost the performance of smaller models of YOLOv6, enhancing the auxiliary regression branch during training and removing it at inference to avoid a marked speed decline.

## Performance Metrics

YOLOv6 provides various pre-trained models with different scales:

- YOLOv6-N: 37.5% AP on COCO val2017 at 1187 FPS with NVIDIA T4 GPU.

        # Train the model on the COCO8 example dataset for 100 epochs
        results = model.train(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)

        # Run inference with the YOLOv6n model on the 'bus.jpg' image
        results = model("path/to/bus.jpg")
        ```

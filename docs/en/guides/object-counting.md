## FAQ

### How do I count objects in a video using Ultralytics YOLO11?

To count objects in a video using Ultralytics YOLO11, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries (`cv2`, `ultralytics`).
2. Define the counting region (e.g., a polygon, line, etc.).
3. Set up the video capture and initialize the object counter.
4. Process each frame to track objects and count them within the defined region.

Here's a simple example for counting in a region:

```python
import cv2

from ultralytics import solutions


def count_objects_in_region(video_path, output_video_path, model_path):
    """Count objects in a specific region within a video."""
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    assert cap.isOpened(), "Error reading video file"
    w, h, fps = (int(cap.get(x)) for x in (cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))
    video_writer = cv2.VideoWriter(output_video_path, cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"mp4v"), fps, (w, h))

    region_points = [(20, 400), (1080, 400), (1080, 360), (20, 360)]
    counter = solutions.ObjectCounter(show=True, region=region_points, model=model_path)

    while cap.isOpened():
        success, im0 = cap.read()
        if not success:
            print("Video frame is empty or processing is complete.")
            break
        results = counter(im0)
        video_writer.write(results.plot_im)

    cap.release()
    video_writer.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()


count_objects_in_region("path/to/video.mp4", "output_video.avi", "yolo11n.pt")
```

For more advanced configurations and options, check out the [RegionCounter solution](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/region-counting/) for counting objects in multiple regions simultaneously.

2. **Enhanced Security:** It enhances security and surveillance by accurately tracking and counting entities, aiding in proactive threat detection and [security systems](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/security-alarm-system/).
3. **Informed Decision-Making:** It offers valuable insights for decision-making, optimizing processes in domains like retail, traffic management, and more.
4. **Real-time Processing:** YOLO11's architecture enables [real-time inference](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/real-time-inference), making it suitable for live video streams and time-sensitive applications.

For implementation examples and practical applications, explore the [TrackZone solution](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/trackzone/) for tracking objects in specific zones.

### How can I count specific classes of objects using Ultralytics YOLO11?

To count specific classes of objects using Ultralytics YOLO11, you need to specify the classes you are interested in during the tracking phase. Below is a Python example:

```python
import cv2

from ultralytics import solutions


def count_specific_classes(video_path, output_video_path, model_path, classes_to_count):
    """Count specific classes of objects in a video."""
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    assert cap.isOpened(), "Error reading video file"
    w, h, fps = (int(cap.get(x)) for x in (cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))
    video_writer = cv2.VideoWriter(output_video_path, cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"mp4v"), fps, (w, h))

    line_points = [(20, 400), (1080, 400)]
    counter = solutions.ObjectCounter(show=True, region=line_points, model=model_path, classes=classes_to_count)

    while cap.isOpened():
        success, im0 = cap.read()
        if not success:
            print("Video frame is empty or processing is complete.")
            break
        results = counter(im0)
        video_writer.write(results.plot_im)

    cap.release()
    video_writer.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()


count_specific_classes("path/to/video.mp4", "output_specific_classes.avi", "yolo11n.pt", [0, 2])
```

In this example, `classes_to_count=[0, 2]` means it counts objects of class `0` and `2` (e.g., person and car in the COCO dataset). You can find more information about class indices in the [COCO dataset documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco/).

# xView Dataset

The [xView](http://xviewdataset.org/) dataset is one of the largest publicly available datasets of overhead imagery, containing images from complex scenes around the world annotated using bounding boxes. The goal of the xView dataset is to accelerate progress in four [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) frontiers:

1. Reduce minimum resolution for detection.
2. Improve learning efficiency.
3. Enable discovery of more object classes.
4. Improve detection of fine-grained classes.

xView builds on the success of challenges like [Common Objects in Context (COCO)](../detect/coco.md) and aims to leverage computer vision to analyze the growing amount of available imagery from space in order to understand the visual world in new ways and address a range of important applications.

## Key Features

- xView contains over 1 million object instances across 60 classes.
- The dataset has a resolution of 0.3 meters, providing higher resolution imagery than most public satellite imagery datasets.
- xView features a diverse collection of small, rare, fine-grained, and multi-type objects with [bounding box](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/bounding-box) annotation.
- Comes with a pre-trained baseline model using the [TensorFlow](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/tensorflow) object detection API and an example for [PyTorch](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/pytorch).

## Dataset Structure

The xView dataset is composed of satellite images collected from WorldView-3 satellites at a 0.3m ground sample distance. It contains over 1 million objects across 60 classes in over 1,400 km² of imagery. The dataset is particularly valuable for [remote sensing](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/using-computer-vision-to-analyse-satellite-imagery) applications and environmental monitoring.

## Applications

The xView dataset is widely used for training and evaluating [deep learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/deep-learning-dl) models for object detection in overhead imagery. The dataset's diverse set of object classes and high-resolution imagery make it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of computer vision, especially for satellite imagery analysis. Applications include:

- Military and defense reconnaissance
- Urban planning and development
- Environmental monitoring
- Disaster response and assessment
- Infrastructure mapping and management

## Dataset YAML

A YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) file is used to define the dataset configuration. It contains information about the dataset's paths, classes, and other relevant information. In the case of the xView dataset, the `xView.yaml` file is maintained at [https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/xView.yaml](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/xView.yaml).

!!! example "ultralytics/cfg/datasets/xView.yaml"

    ```yaml
    --8<-- "ultralytics/cfg/datasets/xView.yaml"
    ```

## Usage

To train a model on the xView dataset for 100 [epochs](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/epoch) with an image size of 640, you can use the following code snippets. For a comprehensive list of available arguments, refer to the model [Training](../../modes/train.md) page.

        # Start training from a pretrained *.pt model
        yolo detect train data=xView.yaml model=yolo11n.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640
        ```

- **Overhead Imagery**: This image demonstrates an example of [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) in overhead imagery, where objects are annotated with bounding boxes. The dataset provides high-resolution satellite images to facilitate the development of models for this task.

The example showcases the variety and complexity of the data in the xView dataset and highlights the importance of high-quality satellite imagery for object detection tasks.

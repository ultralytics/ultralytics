## Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi 3, 4 or 5
- Pi Camera
- 64-bit Raspberry Pi Operating System

Connect the Pi Camera to your Raspberry Pi via a CSI cable and install the 64-bit Raspberry Pi Operating System. Verify your camera with the following command:

```bash
libcamera-hello
```

You should see a video feed from your camera.

## Choose Your YOLO Version: YOLOv5 or YOLOv8

This guide offers you the flexibility to start with either [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) or [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). Both versions have their unique advantages and use-cases. The choice is yours, but remember, the guide's aim is not just quick setup but also a robust foundation for your future work in object detection.

## Quick Start with YOLOv5

This section outlines how to set up YOLOv5 on a Raspberry Pi with a Pi Camera. These steps are designed to be compatible with the libcamera camera stack introduced in Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye.

### Install Necessary Packages

1. Update the Raspberry Pi:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade -y
    sudo apt-get autoremove -y
    ```

2. Clone the YOLOv5 repository:

    ```bash
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/Ultralytics/yolov5.git
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd ~/yolov5
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. For Raspberry Pi 3, install compatible versions of PyTorch and Torchvision (skip for Raspberry Pi 4):

    ```bash
    pip3 uninstall torch torchvision
    pip3 install torch==1.11.0 torchvision==0.12.0
    ```

### Modify `detect.py`

To enable TCP streams via SSH or the CLI, minor modifications are needed in `detect.py`.

1. Open `detect.py`:

    ```bash
    sudo nano ~/yolov5/detect.py
    ```

2. Find and modify the `is_url` line to accept TCP streams:

    ```python
    is_url = source.lower().startswith(("rtsp://", "rtmp://", "http://", "https://", "tcp://"))
    ```

3. Comment out the `view_img` line:

    ```python
    # view_img = check_imshow(warn=True)
    ```

4. Save and exit:

    ```bash
    CTRL + O - - + X > ENTER > CTRL
    ```

### Initiate TCP Stream with Libcamera

1. Start the TCP stream:

    ```bash
    libcamera-vid -n -t 0 --width 1280 --height 960 --framerate 1 --inline --listen -o tcp://127.0.0.1:8888
    ```

Keep this terminal session running for the next steps.

### Perform YOLOv5 Inference

1. Run the YOLOv5 detection:

    ```bash
    cd ~/yolov5
    python3 detect.py --source=tcp://127.0.0.1:8888
    ```

## Quick Start with YOLOv8

Follow this section if you are interested in setting up YOLOv8 instead. The steps are quite similar but are tailored for YOLOv8's specific needs.

### Install Necessary Packages

1. Update the Raspberry Pi:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade -y
    sudo apt-get autoremove -y
    ```

2. Install the `ultralytics` Python package:

    ```bash
    pip3 install ultralytics
    ```

3. Reboot:

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

### Initiate TCP Stream with Libcamera

1. Start the TCP stream:

    ```bash
    libcamera-vid -n -t 0 --width 1280 --height 960 --framerate 1 --inline --listen -o tcp://127.0.0.1:8888
    ```

### Perform YOLOv8 Inference

To perform inference with YOLOv8, you can use the following Python code snippet:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")
results = model("tcp://127.0.0.1:8888", stream=True)

while True:
    for result in results:
        boxes = result.boxes
        probs = result.probs
```

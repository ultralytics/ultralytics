# Train YOLOv5 on Custom Data

ðŸ“š This guide explains how to train your own **custom dataset** using the [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) model ðŸš€. Training custom models is a fundamental step in tailoring [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) solutions to specific real-world applications beyond generic [object detection](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/).

## Before You Start

First, ensure you have the necessary environment set up. Clone the YOLOv5 repository and install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`. A [**Python>=3.8.0**](https://www.python.org/) environment with [**PyTorch>=1.8**](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) is essential. Models and datasets are automatically downloaded from the latest YOLOv5 [release](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases) if they are not found locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 # Clone the repository
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install dependencies
```

Developing a custom [object detection](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/) model is an iterative process:

1.  **Collect & Organize Images**: Gather images relevant to your specific task. High-quality, diverse data is crucial. See our guide on [Data Collection and Annotation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/data-collection-and-annotation/).
2.  **Label Objects**: Annotate the objects of interest within your images accurately.
3.  **Train a Model**: Use the labeled data to [train](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/) your YOLOv5 model. Leverage [transfer learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/transfer-learning) by starting with pretrained weights.
4.  **Deploy & Predict**: Utilize the trained model for [inference](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/predict/) on new, unseen data.
5.  **Collect Edge Cases**: Identify scenarios where the model performs poorly ([edge cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case)) and add similar data to your dataset to improve robustness. Repeat the cycle.

[Ultralytics HUB](https://docs.ultralytics.com/hub/) offers a streamlined, no-code solution for this entire [machine learning operations (MLOps)](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-operations-mlops) cycle, including dataset management, model training, and deployment.

    Explore our licensing options further on the [Ultralytics Licensing](https://www.ultralytics.com/license) page.

Before initiating the training, dataset preparation is essential.

## 1. Create a Dataset

YOLOv5 models require labeled data to learn the visual characteristics of object classes. Organizing your dataset correctly is key.

### 1.1 Create `dataset.yaml`

The dataset configuration file (e.g., `coco128.yaml`) outlines the dataset's structure, class names, and paths to image directories. [COCO128](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco128/) serves as a small example dataset, comprising the first 128 images from the extensive [COCO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco/) dataset. It's useful for quickly testing the training pipeline and diagnosing potential issues like [overfitting](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/overfitting).

The `dataset.yaml` file structure includes:

- `path`: The root directory containing the dataset.
- `train`, `val`, `test`: Relative paths from `path` to directories containing images or text files listing image paths for training, validation, and testing sets.
- `names`: A dictionary mapping class indices (starting from 0) to their corresponding class names.

Below is the structure for `coco128.yaml` ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/data/coco128.yaml)):

```yaml
# Dataset root directory relative to the yolov5 directory
path: ../datasets/coco128

# Train/val/test sets: specify directories, *.txt files, or lists
train: images/train2017 # 128 images for training
val: images/train2017 # 128 images for validation
test: # Optional path to test images

# Classes (example using 80 COCO classes)
names:
    0: person
    1: bicycle
    2: car
    # ... (remaining COCO classes)
    77: teddy bear
    78: hair drier
    79: toothbrush
```

### 1.2 Leverage Models for Automated Labeling

While manual labeling using tools is a common approach, the process can be time-consuming. Recent advancements in foundation models offer possibilities for automating or semi-automating the annotation process, potentially speeding up dataset creation significantly. Here are a few examples of models that can assist with generating labels:

- **[Google Gemini](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/how-to-use-google-gemini-models-for-object-detection-image-captioning-and-ocr.ipynb)**: Large multimodal models like Gemini possess powerful image understanding capabilities. They can be prompted to identify and locate objects within images, generating bounding boxes or descriptions that can be converted into YOLO format labels. Explore its potential in the provided tutorial notebook.
- **[SAM2 (Segment Anything Model 2)](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/sam-2/)**: Foundation models focused on segmentation, like SAM2, can identify and delineate objects with high precision. While primarily for segmentation, the resulting masks can often be converted into bounding box annotations suitable for object detection tasks.
- **[YOLOWorld](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo-world/)**: This model offers open-vocabulary detection capabilities. You can provide text descriptions of the objects you're interested in, and YOLOWorld can locate them in images _without_ prior training on those specific classes. This can be used as a starting point for generating initial labels, which can then be refined.

Using these models can provide a "pre-labeling" step, reducing the manual effort required. However, it's crucial to review and refine automatically generated labels to ensure accuracy and consistency, as the quality directly impacts the performance of your trained YOLOv5 model. After generating (and potentially refining) your labels, ensure they adhere to the **YOLO format**: one `*.txt` file per image, with each line representing an object as `class_index x_center y_center width height` (normalized coordinates, zero-indexed class). If an image has no objects of interest, no corresponding `*.txt` file is needed.

The YOLO format `*.txt` file specifications are precise:

- One row per object [bounding box](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/bounding-box).
- Each row must contain: `class_index x_center y_center width height`.
- Coordinates must be **normalized** to a range between 0 and 1. To achieve this, divide the pixel values of `x_center` and `width` by the image's total width, and divide `y_center` and `height` by the image's total height.
- Class indices are zero-indexed (i.e., the first class is represented by `0`, the second by `1`, and so forth).

<p align="center"><img width="750" src="https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/two-persons-tie.avif" alt="Example image with two persons and a tie annotated"></p>

The label file corresponding to the image above, containing two 'person' objects (class index `0`) and one 'tie' object (class index `27`), would look like this:

<p align="center"><img width="428" src="https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/two-persons-tie-1.avif" alt="Example YOLO format label file content for the annotated image"></p>

### 1.3 Organize Directories

Structure your [datasets](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/) directory as illustrated below. By default, YOLOv5 anticipates the dataset directory (e.g., `/coco128`) to reside within a `/datasets` folder located **adjacent to** the `/yolov5` repository directory.

YOLOv5 automatically locates the labels for each image by substituting the last instance of `/images/` in the image path with `/labels/`. For example:

```bash
../datasets/coco128/images/im0.jpg # Path to the image file
../datasets/coco128/labels/im0.txt # Path to the corresponding label file
```

The recommended directory structure is:

```
/datasets/
â””â”€â”€ coco128/  # Dataset root
    â”œâ”€â”€ images/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train2017/  # Training images
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 000000000009.jpg
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ val2017/    # Validation images (optional if using same set for train/val)
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ labels/
        â”œâ”€â”€ train2017/  # Training labels
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 000000000009.txt
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
        â””â”€â”€ val2017/    # Validation labels (optional if using same set for train/val)
            â””â”€â”€ ...
```

<p align="center"><img width="700" src="https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/yolov5-dataset-structure.avif" alt="Diagram showing the recommended YOLOv5 dataset directory structure"></p>

## 2. Select a Model

Choose a [pretrained model](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/) to initiate the training process. Starting with pretrained weights significantly accelerates learning and improves performance compared to training from scratch. YOLOv5 offers various model sizes, each balancing speed and accuracy differently. For example, [YOLOv5s](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/models/yolov5s.yaml) is the second-smallest and fastest model, suitable for resource-constrained environments. Consult the [README table](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5#pretrained-checkpoints) for a detailed comparison of all available [models](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/).

<p align="center"><img width="800" alt="Comparison chart of YOLOv5 models showing size, speed, and accuracy" src="https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/yolov5-model-comparison.avif"></p>

## 3. Train

Begin the [model training](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/) using the `train.py` script. Essential arguments include:

- `--img`: Defines the input [image size](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cfg/#image-size) (e.g., `--img 640`). Larger sizes generally yield better accuracy but require more GPU memory.
- `--batch`: Determines the [batch size](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/batch-size) (e.g., `--batch 16`). Choose the largest size your GPU can handle.
- `--epochs`: Specifies the total number of training [epochs](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/epoch) (e.g., `--epochs 100`). One epoch represents a full pass over the entire training dataset.
- `--data`: Path to your `dataset.yaml` file (e.g., `--data coco128.yaml`).
- `--weights`: Path to the initial weights file. Using pretrained weights (e.g., `--weights yolov5s.pt`) is highly recommended for faster convergence and superior results. To train from scratch (not advised unless you have a very large dataset and specific needs), use `--weights '' --cfg yolov5s.yaml`.

Pretrained weights are automatically downloaded from the [latest YOLOv5 release](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases) if not found locally.

```bash
# Example: Train YOLOv5s on the COCO128 dataset for 3 epochs
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 3 --data coco128.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt
```

!!! tip "Optimize Training Speed"

    ðŸ’¡ Employ `--cache ram` or `--cache disk` to cache dataset images in [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory) or local disk, respectively. This dramatically accelerates training, particularly when dataset I/O (Input/Output) operations are a bottleneck. Note that this requires substantial RAM or disk space.

!!! tip "Local Data Storage"

    ðŸ’¡ Always train using datasets stored locally. Accessing data from network drives (like Google Drive) or remote storage can be significantly slower and impede training performance. Copying your dataset to a local SSD is often the best practice.

All training outputs, including weights and logs, are saved in the `runs/train/` directory. Each training session creates a new subdirectory (e.g., `runs/train/exp`, `runs/train/exp2`, etc.). For an interactive, hands-on experience, explore the training section in our official tutorial notebooks: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"></a> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/models/ultralytics/yolov5"><img src="https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg" alt="Open In Kaggle"></a>

## FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I train YOLOv5 on my custom dataset?

Training YOLOv5 on a custom dataset involves several key steps:

1.  **Prepare Your Dataset**: Collect images and annotate them. Ensure annotations are in the required [YOLO format](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/). Organize images and labels into `train/` and `val/` (and optionally `test/`) directories. Consider using models like [Google Gemini](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/how-to-use-google-gemini-models-for-object-detection-image-captioning-and-ocr.ipynb), [SAM2](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/sam-2/), or [YOLOWorld](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo-world/) to assist with or automate the labeling process (see Section 1.2).
2.  **Set Up Your Environment**: Clone the YOLOv5 repository and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
    cd yolov5
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Create Dataset Configuration**: Define dataset paths, number of classes, and class names in a `dataset.yaml` file.
4.  **Start Training**: Execute the `train.py` script, providing paths to your `dataset.yaml`, desired pretrained weights (e.g., `yolov5s.pt`), image size, batch size, and the number of epochs.
    ```bash

For a practical walkthrough, check out our blog post: [How to Train Your Custom Models with Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/how-to-train-your-custom-models-with-ultralytics-hub).

### How do I convert my annotated data to the YOLOv5 format?

Whether you annotate manually or use automated tools (like those mentioned in Section 1.2), the final labels must be in the specific **YOLO format** required by YOLOv5:

- Create one `.txt` file for each image. The filename should match the image filename (e.g., `image1.jpg` corresponds to `image1.txt`). Place these files in a `labels/` directory parallel to your `images/` directory (e.g., `../datasets/mydataset/labels/train/`).
- Each line within a `.txt` file represents one object annotation and follows the format: `class_index center_x center_y width height`.
- Coordinates (`center_x`, `center_y`, `width`, `height`) must be **normalized** (values between 0.0 and 1.0) relative to the image's dimensions.
- Class indices are **zero-based** (the first class is `0`, the second is `1`, etc.).

Many manual annotation tools offer direct export to YOLO format. If using automated models, you will need scripts or processes to convert their output (e.g., bounding box coordinates, segmentation masks) into this specific normalized text format. Ensure your final dataset structure adheres to the example provided in the guide. For more details, see our [Data Collection and Annotation Guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/data-collection-and-annotation/).

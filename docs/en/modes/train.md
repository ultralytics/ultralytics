!!! tip

    * YOLO11 datasets like COCO, VOC, ImageNet and many others automatically download on first use, i.e. `yolo train data=coco.yaml`

## Usage Examples

Train YOLO11n on the COCO8 dataset for 100 [epochs](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/epoch) at image size 640. The training device can be specified using the `device` argument. If no argument is passed GPU `device=0` will be used if available, otherwise `device='cpu'` will be used. See Arguments section below for a full list of training arguments.

!!! warning "Windows Multi-Processing Error"

    On Windows, you may receive a `RuntimeError` when launching the training as a script. Add a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block before your training code to resolve it.

!!! example "Single-GPU and CPU Training Example"

    Device is determined automatically. If a GPU is available then it will be used, otherwise training will start on CPU.

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.yaml")  # build a new model from YAML
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.yaml").load("yolo11n.pt")  # build from YAML and transfer weights

        # Train the model
        results = model.train(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Build a new model from YAML and start training from scratch
        yolo detect train data=coco8.yaml model=yolo11n.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=640

        # Start training from a pretrained *.pt model
        yolo detect train data=coco8.yaml model=yolo11n.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640

        # Build a new model from YAML, transfer pretrained weights to it and start training
        yolo detect train data=coco8.yaml model=yolo11n.yaml pretrained=yolo11n.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640
        ```

### Multi-GPU Training

Multi-GPU training allows for more efficient utilization of available hardware resources by distributing the training load across multiple GPUs. This feature is available through both the Python API and the command-line interface. To enable multi-GPU training, specify the GPU device IDs you wish to use.

!!! example "Multi-GPU Training Example"

    To train with 2 GPUs, CUDA devices 0 and 1 use the following commands. Expand to additional GPUs as required.

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)

        # Train the model with 2 GPUs
        results = model.train(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640, device=[0, 1])
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Start training from a pretrained *.pt model using GPUs 0 and 1
        yolo detect train data=coco8.yaml model=yolo11n.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640 device=0,1
        ```

### Apple Silicon MPS Training

With the support for Apple silicon chips integrated in the Ultralytics YOLO models, it's now possible to train your models on devices utilizing the powerful Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) framework. The MPS offers a high-performance way of executing computation and image processing tasks on Apple's custom silicon.

To enable training on Apple silicon chips, you should specify 'mps' as your device when initiating the training process. Below is an example of how you could do this in Python and via the command line:

!!! example "MPS Training Example"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)

        # Train the model with MPS
        results = model.train(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640, device="mps")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Start training from a pretrained *.pt model using MPS
        yolo detect train data=coco8.yaml model=yolo11n.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640 device=mps
        ```

While leveraging the computational power of the Apple silicon chips, this enables more efficient processing of the training tasks. For more detailed guidance and advanced configuration options, please refer to the [PyTorch MPS documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/mps.html).

### Resuming Interrupted Trainings

Resuming training from a previously saved state is a crucial feature when working with deep learning models. This can come in handy in various scenarios, like when the training process has been unexpectedly interrupted, or when you wish to continue training a model with new data or for more epochs.

When training is resumed, Ultralytics YOLO loads the weights from the last saved model and also restores the optimizer state, [learning rate](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/learning-rate) scheduler, and the epoch number. This allows you to continue the training process seamlessly from where it was left off.

You can easily resume training in Ultralytics YOLO by setting the `resume` argument to `True` when calling the `train` method, and specifying the path to the `.pt` file containing the partially trained model weights.

Below is an example of how to resume an interrupted training using Python and via the command line:

!!! example "Resume Training Example"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO("path/to/last.pt")  # load a partially trained model

        # Resume training
        results = model.train(resume=True)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Resume an interrupted training
        yolo train resume model=path/to/last.pt
        ```

By setting `resume=True`, the `train` function will continue training from where it left off, using the state stored in the 'path/to/last.pt' file. If the `resume` argument is omitted or set to `False`, the `train` function will start a new training session.

Remember that checkpoints are saved at the end of every epoch by default, or at fixed intervals using the `save_period` argument, so you must complete at least 1 epoch to resume a training run.

## Train Settings

The training settings for YOLO models encompass various hyperparameters and configurations used during the training process. These settings influence the model's performance, speed, and [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy). Key training settings include batch size, learning rate, momentum, and weight decay. Additionally, the choice of optimizer, [loss function](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/loss-function), and training dataset composition can impact the training process. Careful tuning and experimentation with these settings are crucial for optimizing performance.

{% include "macros/train-args.md" %}

!!! info "Note on Batch-size Settings"

    The `batch` argument can be configured in three ways:

    - **Fixed [Batch Size](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/batch-size)**: Set an integer value (e.g., `batch=16`), specifying the number of images per batch directly.
    - **Auto Mode (60% GPU Memory)**: Use `batch=-1` to automatically adjust batch size for approximately 60% CUDA memory utilization.
    - **Auto Mode with Utilization Fraction**: Set a fraction value (e.g., `batch=0.70`) to adjust batch size based on the specified fraction of GPU memory usage.

## Augmentation Settings and Hyperparameters

Augmentation techniques are essential for improving the robustness and performance of YOLO models by introducing variability into the [training data](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/training-data), helping the model generalize better to unseen data. The following table outlines the purpose and effect of each augmentation argument:

{% include "macros/augmentation-args.md" %}

These settings can be adjusted to meet the specific requirements of the dataset and task at hand. Experimenting with different values can help find the optimal augmentation strategy that leads to the best model performance.

!!! info

    For more information about training augmentation operations, see the [reference section](../reference/data/augment.md).

## Logging

In training a YOLO11 model, you might find it valuable to keep track of the model's performance over time. This is where logging comes into play. Ultralytics' YOLO provides support for three types of loggers - Comet, ClearML, and TensorBoard.

To use a logger, select it from the dropdown menu in the code snippet above and run it. The chosen logger will be installed and initialized.

### Comet

[Comet](../integrations/comet.md) is a platform that allows data scientists and developers to track, compare, explain and optimize experiments and models. It provides functionalities such as real-time metrics, code diffs, and hyperparameters tracking.

To use Comet:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        # pip install comet_ml
        import comet_ml

        comet_ml.init()
        ```

Remember to sign in to your Comet account on their website and get your API key. You will need to add this to your environment variables or your script to log your experiments.

### ClearML

[ClearML](https://clear.ml/) is an open-source platform that automates tracking of experiments and helps with efficient sharing of resources. It is designed to help teams manage, execute, and reproduce their ML work more efficiently.

To use ClearML:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        # pip install clearml
        import clearml

        clearml.browser_login()
        ```

After running this script, you will need to sign in to your ClearML account on the browser and authenticate your session.

### TensorBoard

[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) is a visualization toolkit for [TensorFlow](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/tensorflow). It allows you to visualize your TensorFlow graph, plot quantitative metrics about the execution of your graph, and show additional data like images that pass through it.

To use TensorBoard in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/examples/tutorial.ipynb):

!!! example

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        load_ext tensorboard
        tensorboard --logdir ultralytics/runs  # replace with 'runs' directory
        ```

To use TensorBoard locally run the below command and view results at http://localhost:6006/.

!!! example

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        tensorboard --logdir ultralytics/runs  # replace with 'runs' directory
        ```

This will load TensorBoard and direct it to the directory where your training logs are saved.

After setting up your logger, you can then proceed with your model training. All training metrics will be automatically logged in your chosen platform, and you can access these logs to monitor your model's performance over time, compare different models, and identify areas for improvement.

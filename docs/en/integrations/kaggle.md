### Common Issues While Working with Kaggle

When working with Kaggle, you might come across some common issues. Here are some points to help you navigate the platform smoothly:

- **Access to GPUs**: In your Kaggle notebooks, you can activate a GPU at any time, with usage allowed for up to 30 hours per week. Kaggle provides the NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU with 16GB of memory and also offers the option of using a NVIDIA GPU T4 x2. Powerful hardware accelerates your machine-learning tasks, making model training and inference much faster.
- **Kaggle Kernels**: Kaggle Kernels are free Jupyter notebook servers that can integrate GPUs, allowing you to perform machine learning operations on cloud computers. You don't have to rely on your own computer's CPU, avoiding overload and freeing up your local resources.
- **Kaggle Datasets**: Kaggle datasets are free to download. However, it's important to check the license for each dataset to understand any usage restrictions. Some datasets may have limitations on academic publications or commercial use. You can download datasets directly to your Kaggle notebook or anywhere else via the Kaggle API.
- **Saving and Committing Notebooks**: To save and commit a notebook on Kaggle, click "Save Version." This saves the current state of your notebook. Once the background kernel finishes generating the output files, you can access them from the Output tab on the main notebook page.
- **Collaboration**: Kaggle supports collaboration, but multiple users cannot edit a notebook simultaneously. Collaboration on Kaggle is asynchronous, meaning users can share and work on the same notebook at different times.
- **Reverting to a Previous Version**: If you need to revert to a previous version of your notebook, open the notebook and click on the three vertical dots in the top right corner to select "View Versions." Find the version you want to revert to, click on the "..." menu next to it, and select "Revert to Version." After the notebook reverts, click "Save Version" to commit the changes.

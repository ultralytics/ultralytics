## [Detection](detect.md)

Detection is the primary task supported by YOLO11. It involves identifying objects in an image or video frame and drawing bounding boxes around them. The detected objects are classified into different categories based on their features. YOLO11 can detect multiple objects in a single image or video frame with high [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy) and speed, making it ideal for real-time applications like [surveillance systems](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/shattering-the-surveillance-status-quo-with-vision-ai) and [autonomous vehicles](https://www.ultralytics.com/solutions/ai-in-self-driving).

[Detection Examples](detect.md){ .md-button }

## [Image segmentation](segment.md)

Segmentation takes object detection further by segmenting an image into different regions based on content. Each region is assigned a label, providing pixel-level precision for applications such as [medical imaging](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/ai-and-radiology-a-new-era-of-precision-and-efficiency), [agricultural analysis](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/from-farm-to-table-how-ai-drives-innovation-in-agriculture), and [manufacturing quality control](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/improving-manufacturing-with-computer-vision). YOLO11 implements a variant of the U-Net architecture to perform efficient and accurate segmentation.

[Segmentation Examples](segment.md){ .md-button }

## [Classification](classify.md)

Classification involves categorizing entire images based on their content. YOLO11's classification capabilities leverage a variant of the EfficientNet architecture to deliver high-performance image classification. This task is essential for applications like [product categorization](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/understanding-vision-language-models-and-their-applications) in e-commerce, [content moderation](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/ai-in-document-authentication-with-image-segmentation), and [wildlife monitoring](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/monitoring-animal-behavior-using-ultralytics-yolov8).

[Classification Examples](classify.md){ .md-button }

## [Pose estimation](pose.md)

Pose estimation detects specific keypoints in images or video frames to track movements or estimate poses. These keypoints can represent human joints, facial features, or other significant points of interest. YOLO11 excels at keypoint detection with high accuracy and speed, making it valuable for [fitness applications](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/ai-in-our-day-to-day-health-and-fitness), [sports analytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/exploring-the-applications-of-computer-vision-in-sports), and [human-computer interaction](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/custom-training-ultralytics-yolo11-for-dog-pose-estimation).

[Pose Examples](pose.md){ .md-button }

## [OBB](obb.md)

Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) detection enhances traditional object detection by adding an orientation angle to better locate rotated objects. This capability is particularly valuable for [aerial imagery analysis](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/using-computer-vision-to-analyse-satellite-imagery), [document processing](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/using-ultralytics-yolo11-for-smart-document-analysis), and [industrial applications](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/yolo11-enhancing-efficiency-conveyor-automation) where objects appear at various angles. YOLO11 delivers high accuracy and speed for detecting rotated objects in diverse scenarios.

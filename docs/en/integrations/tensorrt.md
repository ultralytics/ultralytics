</p>

[TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt), developed by NVIDIA, is an advanced software development kit (SDK) designed for high-speed deep learning inference. It's well-suited for real-time applications like [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection).

This toolkit optimizes deep learning models for NVIDIA GPUs and results in faster and more efficient operations. TensorRT models undergo TensorRT optimization, which includes techniques like layer fusion, precision calibration (INT8 and FP16), dynamic tensor memory management, and kernel auto-tuning. Converting deep learning models into the TensorRT format allows developers to realize the potential of NVIDIA GPUs fully.

TensorRT is known for its compatibility with various model formats, including TensorFlow, [PyTorch](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/pytorch), and ONNX, providing developers with a flexible solution for integrating and optimizing models from different frameworks. This versatility enables efficient [model deployment](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/model-deployment) across diverse hardware and software environments.

## Key Features of TensorRT Models

TensorRT models offer a range of key features that contribute to their efficiency and effectiveness in high-speed deep learning inference:

- **Precision Calibration**: TensorRT supports precision calibration, allowing models to be fine-tuned for specific accuracy requirements. This includes support for reduced precision formats like INT8 and FP16, which can further boost inference speed while maintaining acceptable accuracy levels.

- **Layer Fusion**: The TensorRT optimization process includes layer fusion, where multiple layers of a [neural network](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/neural-network-nn) are combined into a single operation. This reduces computational overhead and improves inference speed by minimizing memory access and computation.

</p>

- **Dynamic Tensor Memory Management**: TensorRT efficiently manages tensor memory usage during inference, reducing memory overhead and optimizing memory allocation. This results in more efficient GPU memory utilization.

- **Automatic Kernel Tuning**: TensorRT applies automatic kernel tuning to select the most optimized GPU kernel for each layer of the model. This adaptive approach ensures that the model takes full advantage of the GPU's computational power.

## Deployment Options in TensorRT

Before we look at the code for exporting YOLOv8 models to the TensorRT format, let's understand where TensorRT models are normally used.

TensorRT offers several deployment options, and each option balances ease of integration, performance optimization, and flexibility differently:

- **Deploying within [TensorFlow](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/tensorflow)**: This method integrates TensorRT into TensorFlow, allowing optimized models to run in a familiar TensorFlow environment. It's useful for models with a mix of supported and unsupported layers, as TF-TRT can handle these efficiently.

  <img width="100%" src="https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/tf-trt-workflow.avif" alt="TensorRT Overview">
</p>

- **Standalone TensorRT Runtime API**: Offers granular control, ideal for performance-critical applications. It's more complex but allows for custom implementation of unsupported operators.

- **NVIDIA Triton Inference Server**: An option that supports models from various frameworks. Particularly suited for cloud or edge inference, it provides features like concurrent model execution and model analysis.

### Exporting TensorRT with INT8 Quantization

Exporting Ultralytics YOLO models using TensorRT with INT8 [precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/precision) executes post-training quantization (PTQ). TensorRT uses calibration for PTQ, which measures the distribution of activations within each activation tensor as the YOLO model processes inference on representative input data, and then uses that distribution to estimate scale values for each tensor. Each activation tensor that is a candidate for quantization has an associated scale that is deduced by a calibration process.

When processing implicitly quantized networks TensorRT uses INT8 opportunistically to optimize layer execution time. If a layer runs faster in INT8 and has assigned quantization scales on its data inputs and outputs, then a kernel with INT8 precision is assigned to that layer, otherwise TensorRT selects a precision of either FP32 or FP16 for the kernel based on whichever results in faster execution time for that layer.

!!! tip

    It is **critical** to ensure that the same device that will use the TensorRT model weights for deployment is used for exporting with INT8 precision, as the calibration results can vary across devices.

#### Configuring INT8 Export

The arguments provided when using [export](../modes/export.md) for an Ultralytics YOLO model will **greatly** influence the performance of the exported model. They will also need to be selected based on the device resources available, however the default arguments _should_ work for most [Ampere (or newer) NVIDIA discrete GPUs](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/). The calibration algorithm used is `"ENTROPY_CALIBRATION_2"` and you can read more details about the options available [in the TensorRT Developer Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/developer-guide/index.html#enable_int8_c). Ultralytics tests found that `"ENTROPY_CALIBRATION_2"` was the best choice and exports are fixed to using this algorithm.

- `workspace` : Controls the size (in GiB) of the device memory allocation while converting the model weights.

    - Adjust the `workspace` value according to your calibration needs and resource availability. While a larger `workspace` may increase calibration time, it allows TensorRT to explore a wider range of optimization tactics, potentially enhancing model performance and [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy). Conversely, a smaller `workspace` can reduce calibration time but may limit the optimization strategies, affecting the quality of the quantized model.

    - Default is `workspace=None`, which will allow for TensorRT to automatically allocate memory, when configuring manually, this value may need to be increased if calibration crashes (exits without warning).

    - TensorRT will report `UNSUPPORTED_STATE` during export if the value for `workspace` is larger than the memory available to the device, which means the value for `workspace` should be lowered or set to `None`.

    - If `workspace` is set to max value and calibration fails/crashes, consider using `None` for auto-allocation or by reducing the values for `imgsz` and `batch` to reduce memory requirements.

    - <u><b>Remember</b> calibration for INT8 is specific to each device</u>, borrowing a "high-end" GPU for calibration, might result in poor performance when inference is run on another device.

- `batch` : The maximum batch-size that will be used for inference. During inference smaller batches can be used, but inference will not accept batches any larger than what is specified.

!!! note

    During calibration, twice the `batch` size provided will be used. Using small batches can lead to inaccurate scaling during calibration. This is because the process adjusts based on the data it sees. Small batches might not capture the full range of values, leading to issues with the final calibration, so the `batch` size is doubled automatically. If no [batch size](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/batch-size) is specified `batch=1`, calibration will be run at `batch=1 * 2` to reduce calibration scaling errors.

Experimentation by NVIDIA led them to recommend using at least 500 calibration images that are representative of the data for your model, with INT8 quantization calibration. This is a guideline and not a _hard_ requirement, and <u>**you will need to experiment with what is required to perform well for your dataset**.</u> Since the calibration data is required for INT8 calibration with TensorRT, make certain to use the `data` argument when `int8=True` for TensorRT and use `data="my_dataset.yaml"`, which will use the images from [validation](../modes/val.md) to calibrate with. When no value is passed for `data` with export to TensorRT with INT8 quantization, the default will be to use one of the ["small" example datasets based on the model task](../datasets/index.md) instead of throwing an error.

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```{ .py .annotate }
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")
        model.export(
            format="engine",
            dynamic=True,  # (1)!
            batch=8,  # (2)!
            workspace=4,  # (3)!
            int8=True,
            data="coco.yaml",  # (4)!
        )

        # Load the exported TensorRT INT8 model
        model = YOLO("yolov8n.engine", task="detect")

        # Run inference
        result = model.predict("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")
        ```

        1. Exports with dynamic axes, this will be enabled by default when exporting with `int8=True` even when not explicitly set. See [export arguments](../modes/export.md#arguments) for additional information.
        2. Sets max batch size of 8 for exported model, which calibrates with `batch = 2 * 8` to avoid scaling errors during calibration.
        3. Allocates 4 GiB of memory instead of allocating the entire device for conversion process.
        4. Uses [COCO dataset](../datasets/detect/coco.md) for calibration, specifically the images used for [validation](../modes/val.md) (5,000 total).


    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Export a YOLOv8n PyTorch model to TensorRT format with INT8 quantization
        yolo export model=yolov8n.pt format=engine batch=8 workspace=4 int8=True data=coco.yaml  # creates 'yolov8n.engine''

        # Run inference with the exported TensorRT quantized model
        yolo predict model=yolov8n.engine source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg'
        ```

???+ warning "Calibration Cache"

    TensorRT will generate a calibration `.cache` which can be re-used to speed up export of future model weights using the same data, but this may result in poor calibration when the data is vastly different or if the `batch` value is changed drastically. In these circumstances, the existing `.cache` should be renamed and moved to a different directory or deleted entirely.

#### Advantages of using YOLO with TensorRT INT8

- **Reduced model size:** Quantization from FP32 to INT8 can reduce the model size by 4x (on disk or in memory), leading to faster download times. lower storage requirements, and reduced memory footprint when deploying a model.

- **Lower power consumption:** Reduced precision operations for INT8 exported YOLO models can consume less power compared to FP32 models, especially for battery-powered devices.

- **Improved inference speeds:** TensorRT optimizes the model for the target hardware, potentially leading to faster inference speeds on GPUs, embedded devices, and accelerators.

??? note "Note on Inference Speeds"

    The first few inference calls with a model exported to TensorRT INT8 can be expected to have longer than usual preprocessing, inference, and/or postprocessing times. This may also occur when changing `imgsz` during inference, especially when `imgsz` is not the same as what was specified during export (export `imgsz` is set as TensorRT "optimal" profile).

#### Drawbacks of using YOLO with TensorRT INT8

- **Decreases in evaluation metrics:** Using a lower precision will mean that `mAP`, `Precision`, `Recall` or any [other metric used to evaluate model performance](../guides/yolo-performance-metrics.md) is likely to be somewhat worse. See the [Performance results section](#ultralytics-yolo-tensorrt-export-performance) to compare the differences in `mAP50` and `mAP50-95` when exporting with INT8 on small sample of various devices.

- **Increased development times:** Finding the "optimal" settings for INT8 calibration for dataset and device can take a significant amount of testing.

- **Hardware dependency:** Calibration and performance gains could be highly hardware dependent and model weights are less transferable.

    model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")
    model.export(format="engine", batch=8, workspace=4, int8=True, data="coco.yaml")
    ```

2. **Run inference**:

    ```python
    from ultralytics import YOLO

    model = YOLO("yolov8n.engine", task="detect")
    result = model.predict("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")
    ```

### What are the performance improvements observed with YOLOv8 models exported to TensorRT?

Performance improvements with TensorRT can vary based on the hardware used. Here are some typical benchmarks:

- **NVIDIA A100**:

    - **FP32** Inference: ~0.52 ms / image
    - **FP16** Inference: ~0.34 ms / image
    - **INT8** Inference: ~0.28 ms / image
    - Slight reduction in mAP with INT8 precision, but significant improvement in speed.

- **Consumer GPUs (e.g., RTX 3080)**:
    - **FP32** Inference: ~1.06 ms / image
    - **FP16** Inference: ~0.62 ms / image
    - **INT8** Inference: ~0.52 ms / image

Detailed performance benchmarks for different hardware configurations can be found in the [performance section](#ultralytics-yolo-tensorrt-export-performance).

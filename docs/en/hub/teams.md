### Seats

The [Pro Plan](./pro.md) offers one free seat _(yours)_.

When a new unique member joins one of your teams, the number of seats increases, and you will be charged **$20 per month** for each seat, or **$200 per year** if you choose the annual plan.

Each unique member counts as one seat, regardless of how many teams they are in. For example, if John Doe is a member of 5 of your teams, he is using one seat.

When you remove a unique member from the last team they are a member of, the number of seats decreases. The charge is prorated and can be applied to adding other unique members, paying for the [Pro Plan](./pro.md), or topping up your [account balance](./pro.md#account-balance).

You can see the number of seats on the [Teams](https://hub.ultralytics.com/settings?tab=teams) page.

# CoreML Export for YOLO11 Models

Deploying [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv) models on Apple devices like iPhones and Macs requires a format that ensures seamless performance.

The CoreML export format allows you to optimize your [Ultralytics YOLO11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) models for efficient [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) in iOS and macOS applications. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps for converting your models to the CoreML format, making it easier for your models to perform well on Apple devices.

## CoreML

</p>

[CoreML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) is Apple's foundational machine learning framework that builds upon Accelerate, BNNS, and Metal Performance Shaders. It provides a machine-learning model format that seamlessly integrates into iOS applications and supports tasks such as image analysis, [natural language processing](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/natural-language-processing-nlp), audio-to-text conversion, and sound analysis.

Applications can take advantage of Core ML without the need to have a network connection or API calls because the Core ML framework works using on-device computing. This means model inference can be performed locally on the user's device.

## Key Features of CoreML Models

Apple's CoreML framework offers robust features for on-device machine learning. Here are the key features that make CoreML a powerful tool for developers:

- **Comprehensive Model Support**: Converts and runs models from popular frameworks like TensorFlow, [PyTorch](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/pytorch), scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LibSVM.

</p>

- **On-device [Machine Learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml)**: Ensures data privacy and swift processing by executing models directly on the user's device, eliminating the need for network connectivity.

- **Performance and Optimization**: Uses the device's CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine for optimal performance with minimal power and memory usage. Offers tools for model compression and optimization while maintaining [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy).

- **Ease of Integration**: Provides a unified format for various model types and a user-friendly API for seamless integration into apps. Supports domain-specific tasks through frameworks like Vision and Natural Language.

- **Advanced Features**: Includes on-device training capabilities for personalized experiences, asynchronous predictions for interactive ML experiences, and model inspection and validation tools.

## CoreML Deployment Options

Before we look at the code for exporting YOLO11 models to the CoreML format, let's understand where CoreML models are usually used.

CoreML offers various deployment options for machine learning models, including:

- **On-Device Deployment**: This method directly integrates CoreML models into your iOS app. It's particularly advantageous for ensuring low latency, enhanced privacy (since data remains on the device), and offline functionality. This approach, however, may be limited by the device's hardware capabilities, especially for larger and more complex models. On-device deployment can be executed in the following two ways.

    - **Embedded Models**: These models are included in the app bundle and are immediately accessible. They are ideal for small models that do not require frequent updates.

    - **Downloaded Models**: These models are fetched from a server as needed. This approach is suitable for larger models or those needing regular updates. It helps keep the app bundle size smaller.

- **Cloud-Based Deployment**: CoreML models are hosted on servers and accessed by the iOS app through API requests. This scalable and flexible option enables easy model updates without app revisions. It's ideal for complex models or large-scale apps requiring regular updates. However, it does require an internet connection and may pose latency and security issues.

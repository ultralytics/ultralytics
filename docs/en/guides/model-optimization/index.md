# Model Optimization

Model optimization techniques help improve the efficiency, size, and speed of YOLO models for deployment in resource-constrained or real-time environments.

Currently supported:

- **[Pruning](pruning.md)** – Remove less important parameters to reduce model size and latency while maintaining accuracy.

## How Does Neural Magic's DeepSparse Technology Work?

Neural Magic's Deep Sparse technology is inspired by the human brain's efficiency in neural network computation. It adopts two key principles from the brain as follows:

- **Sparsity**: The process of sparsification involves pruning redundant information from [deep learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/deep-learning-dl) networks, leading to smaller and faster models without compromising accuracy. This technique reduces the network's size and computational needs significantly.

- **Locality of Reference**: DeepSparse uses a unique execution method, breaking the network into Tensor Columns. These columns are executed depth-wise, fitting entirely within the CPU's cache. This approach mimics the brain's efficiency, minimizing data movement and maximizing the CPU's cache use.

## Usage: Deploying YOLO11 using DeepSparse

Deploying YOLO11 with Neural Magic's DeepSparse involves a few straightforward steps. Before diving into the usage instructions, be sure to check out the range of [YOLO11 models offered by Ultralytics](../models/index.md). This will help you choose the most appropriate model for your project requirements. Here's how you can get started.

### Step 1: Installation

To install the required packages, run:

!!! tip "Installation"

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Install the required packages
        pip install deepsparse[yolov8]
        ```

### Step 2: Exporting YOLO11 to ONNX Format

DeepSparse Engine requires YOLO11 models in [ONNX format](../integrations/onnx.md). Exporting your model to this format is essential for compatibility with DeepSparse. Use the following command to export YOLO11 models:

!!! tip "Model Export"

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Export YOLO11 model to ONNX format
        yolo task=detect mode=export model=yolo11n.pt format=onnx opset=13
        ```

This command will save the `yolo11n.onnx` model to your disk.

### Step 3: Deploying and Running Inferences

With your YOLO11 model in ONNX format, you can deploy and run inferences using DeepSparse. This can be done easily with their intuitive Python API:

!!! tip "Deploying and Running Inferences"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from deepsparse import Pipeline

        # Specify the path to your YOLO11 ONNX model
        model_path = "path/to/yolo11n.onnx"

        # Set up the DeepSparse Pipeline
        yolo_pipeline = Pipeline.create(task="yolov8", model_path=model_path)

        # Run the model on your images
        images = ["path/to/image.jpg"]
        pipeline_outputs = yolo_pipeline(images=images)
        ```

### Step 4: Benchmarking Performance

It's important to check that your YOLO11 model is performing optimally on DeepSparse. You can [benchmark](../modes/benchmark.md) your model's performance to analyze throughput and latency:

!!! tip "Benchmarking"

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Benchmark performance
        deepsparse.benchmark model_path="path/to/yolo11n.onnx" --scenario=sync --input_shapes="[1,3,640,640]"
        ```

### Step 5: Additional Features

DeepSparse provides additional features for practical integration of YOLO11 in applications, such as image annotation and dataset evaluation.

!!! tip "Additional Features"

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # For image annotation
        deepsparse.yolov8.annotate --source "path/to/image.jpg" --model_filepath "path/to/yolo11n.onnx"

        # For evaluating model performance on a dataset
        deepsparse.yolov8.eval --model_path "path/to/yolo11n.onnx"
        ```

Running the annotate command processes your specified image, detecting objects, and saving the annotated image with bounding boxes and classifications. The annotated image will be stored in an annotation-results folder. This helps provide a visual representation of the model's detection capabilities.

</p>

After running the eval command, you will receive detailed output metrics such as [precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/precision), [recall](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/recall), and [mAP](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/mean-average-precision-map) (mean Average Precision). This provides a comprehensive view of your model's performance on the dataset. This functionality is particularly useful for fine-tuning and optimizing your YOLO11 models for specific use cases, ensuring high accuracy and efficiency.

# Fashion-MNIST Dataset

The [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset is a database of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Fashion-MNIST is intended to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking [machine learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml) algorithms.

## Key Features

- Fashion-MNIST contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of Zalando's article images.
- The dataset comprises grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels.
- Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255.
- Fashion-MNIST is widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning, especially for image classification tasks.

## Dataset Structure

The Fashion-MNIST dataset is split into two subsets:

1. **Training Set**: This subset contains 60,000 images used for training machine learning models.
2. **Testing Set**: This subset consists of 10,000 images used for testing and benchmarking the trained models.

## Labels

Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

```
0. T-shirt/top
1. Trouser
2. Pullover
3. Dress
4. Coat
5. Sandal
6. Shirt
7. Sneaker
8. Bag
9. Ankle boot
```

## Applications

The Fashion-MNIST dataset is widely used for training and evaluating deep learning models in image classification tasks, such as [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/convolutional-neural-network-cnn) (CNNs), [Support Vector Machines](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/support-vector-machine-svm) (SVMs), and various other machine learning algorithms. The dataset's simple and well-structured format makes it an essential resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of machine learning and computer vision.

## Usage

To train a CNN model on the Fashion-MNIST dataset for 100 [epochs](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/epoch) with an image size of 28x28, you can use the following code snippets. For a comprehensive list of available arguments, refer to the model [Training](../../modes/train.md) page.

## FAQ

### What is the Fashion-MNIST dataset and how is it different from MNIST?

The [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of Zalando's article images, intended as a modern replacement for the original MNIST dataset. It serves as a benchmark for machine learning models in the context of image classification tasks. Unlike MNIST, which contains handwritten digits, Fashion-MNIST consists of 28x28-pixel images categorized into 10 fashion-related classes, such as T-shirt/top, trouser, and ankle boot.

### How can I train a YOLO model on the Fashion-MNIST dataset?

To train an Ultralytics YOLO model on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, you can use both Python and CLI commands. Here's a quick example to get you started:

!!! example "Train Example"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pretrained model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n-cls.pt")

        # Train the model on Fashion-MNIST
        results = model.train(data="fashion-mnist", epochs=100, imgsz=28)
        ```


    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo classify train data=fashion-mnist model=yolo11n-cls.pt epochs=100 imgsz=28
        ```

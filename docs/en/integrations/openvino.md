# Intel OpenVINO Export

<img width="1024" src="https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/openvino-ecosystem.avif" alt="OpenVINO Ecosystem">

In this guide, we cover exporting YOLOv8 models to the [OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai/) format, which can provide up to 3x [CPU](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/running-inference/inference-devices-and-modes/cpu-device.html) speedup, as well as accelerating YOLO inference on Intel [GPU](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/running-inference/inference-devices-and-modes/gpu-device.html) and [NPU](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/running-inference/inference-devices-and-modes/npu-device.html) hardware.

OpenVINO, short for Open Visual Inference & [Neural Network](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/neural-network-nn) Optimization toolkit, is a comprehensive toolkit for optimizing and deploying AI inference models. Even though the name contains Visual, OpenVINO also supports various additional tasks including language, audio, time series, etc.

## Usage Examples

Export a YOLOv8n model to OpenVINO format and run inference with the exported model.

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a YOLOv8n PyTorch model
        model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

        # Export the model
        model.export(format="openvino")  # creates 'yolov8n_openvino_model/'

        # Load the exported OpenVINO model
        ov_model = YOLO("yolov8n_openvino_model/")

        # Run inference
        results = ov_model("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Export a YOLOv8n PyTorch model to OpenVINO format
        yolo export model=yolov8n.pt format=openvino  # creates 'yolov8n_openvino_model/'

## Benefits of OpenVINO

1. **Performance**: OpenVINO delivers high-performance inference by utilizing the power of Intel CPUs, integrated and discrete GPUs, and FPGAs.
2. **Support for Heterogeneous Execution**: OpenVINO provides an API to write once and deploy on any supported Intel hardware (CPU, GPU, FPGA, VPU, etc.).
3. **Model Optimizer**: OpenVINO provides a Model Optimizer that imports, converts, and optimizes models from popular [deep learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/deep-learning-dl) frameworks such as PyTorch, [TensorFlow](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/tensorflow), TensorFlow Lite, Keras, ONNX, PaddlePaddle, and Caffe.
4. **Ease of Use**: The toolkit comes with more than [80 tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks) (including [YOLOv8 optimization](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/tree/latest/notebooks/yolov8-optimization)) teaching different aspects of the toolkit.

## OpenVINO Export Structure

When you export a model to OpenVINO format, it results in a directory containing the following:

1. **XML file**: Describes the network topology.
2. **BIN file**: Contains the weights and biases binary data.
3. **Mapping file**: Holds mapping of original model output tensors to OpenVINO tensor names.

You can use these files to run inference with the OpenVINO Inference Engine.

## Using OpenVINO Export in Deployment

Once you have the OpenVINO files, you can use the OpenVINO Runtime to run the model. The Runtime provides a unified API to inference across all supported Intel hardware. It also provides advanced capabilities like load balancing across Intel hardware and asynchronous execution. For more information on running the inference, refer to the [Inference with OpenVINO Runtime Guide](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/running-inference.html).

Remember, you'll need the XML and BIN files as well as any application-specific settings like input size, scale factor for normalization, etc., to correctly set up and use the model with the Runtime.

In your deployment application, you would typically do the following steps:

1. Initialize OpenVINO by creating `core = Core()`.
2. Load the model using the `core.read_model()` method.
3. Compile the model using the `core.compile_model()` function.
4. Prepare the input (image, text, audio, etc.).
5. Run inference using `compiled_model(input_data)`.

For more detailed steps and code snippets, refer to the [OpenVINO documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/) or [API tutorial](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/blob/latest/notebooks/openvino-api/openvino-api.ipynb).

## Reproduce Our Results

To reproduce the Ultralytics benchmarks above on all export [formats](../modes/export.md) run this code:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a YOLOv8n PyTorch model
        model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

        # Benchmark YOLOv8n speed and accuracy on the COCO8 dataset for all export formats
        results = model.benchmark(data="coco8.yaml")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Benchmark YOLOv8n speed and accuracy on the COCO8 dataset for all export formats
        yolo benchmark model=yolov8n.pt data=coco8.yaml
        ```

    Note that benchmarking results might vary based on the exact hardware and software configuration of a system, as well as the current workload of the system at the time the benchmarks are run. For the most reliable results use a dataset with a large number of images, i.e. `data='coco128.yaml' (128 val images), or `data='coco.yaml'` (5000 val images).

## Conclusion

The benchmarking results clearly demonstrate the benefits of exporting the YOLOv8 model to the OpenVINO format. Across different models and hardware platforms, the OpenVINO format consistently outperforms other formats in terms of inference speed while maintaining comparable accuracy.

For the Intel® Data Center GPU Flex Series, the OpenVINO format was able to deliver inference speeds almost 10 times faster than the original PyTorch format. On the Xeon CPU, the OpenVINO format was twice as fast as the PyTorch format. The accuracy of the models remained nearly identical across the different formats.

The benchmarks underline the effectiveness of OpenVINO as a tool for deploying deep learning models. By converting models to the OpenVINO format, developers can achieve significant performance improvements, making it easier to deploy these models in real-world applications.

For more detailed information and instructions on using OpenVINO, refer to the [official OpenVINO documentation](https://docs.openvino.ai/).

## FAQ

### How do I export YOLOv8 models to OpenVINO format?

Exporting YOLOv8 models to the OpenVINO format can significantly enhance CPU speed and enable GPU and NPU accelerations on Intel hardware. To export, you can use either Python or CLI as shown below:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a YOLOv8n PyTorch model
        model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

        # Export the model
        model.export(format="openvino")  # creates 'yolov8n_openvino_model/'
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Export a YOLOv8n PyTorch model to OpenVINO format
        yolo export model=yolov8n.pt format=openvino  # creates 'yolov8n_openvino_model/'
        ```

For more information, refer to the [export formats documentation](../modes/export.md).

### How can I run inference using a YOLOv8 model exported to OpenVINO?

After exporting a YOLOv8 model to OpenVINO format, you can run inference using Python or CLI:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load the exported OpenVINO model
        ov_model = YOLO("yolov8n_openvino_model/")

        # Run inference
        results = ov_model("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Run inference with the exported model
        yolo predict model=yolov8n_openvino_model source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg'
        ```

Refer to our [predict mode documentation](../modes/predict.md) for more details.

        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a YOLOv8n PyTorch model
        model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

        # Benchmark YOLOv8n speed and [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy) on the COCO8 dataset for all export formats
        results = model.benchmark(data="coco8.yaml")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Benchmark YOLOv8n speed and accuracy on the COCO8 dataset for all export formats
        yolo benchmark model=yolov8n.pt data=coco8.yaml
        ```

class DistanceCalculation(BaseSolution):
    """
    A class to calculate distance between two objects in a real-time video stream based on their tracks.

    This class extends BaseSolution to provide functionality for selecting objects and calculating the distance
    between them in a video stream using YOLO object detection and tracking.

    Attributes:
        left_mouse_count (int): Counter for left mouse button clicks.
        selected_boxes (Dict[int, List[float]]): Dictionary to store selected bounding boxes and their track IDs.
        centroids (List[List[int]]): List to store centroids of selected bounding boxes.

    Methods:
        mouse_event_for_distance: Handle mouse events for selecting objects in the video stream.
        process: Process video frames and calculate the distance between selected objects.

    Examples:
        >>> distance_calc = DistanceCalculation()
        >>> frame = cv2.imread("frame.jpg")
        >>> results = distance_calc.process(frame)
        >>> cv2.imshow("Distance Calculation", results.plot_im)

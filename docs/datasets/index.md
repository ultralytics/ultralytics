## [Pose Estimation](pose/index.md)

Pose estimation is a technique used to determine the pose of the object relative to the camera or the world coordinate system.

## [Classification](classify/index.md)

Image classification is a computer vision task that involves categorizing an image into one or more predefined classes or categories based on its visual content.

- [Caltech 101](classify/caltech101.md): A dataset containing images of 101 object categories for image classification tasks.
- [Caltech 256](classify/caltech256.md): An extended version of Caltech 101 with 256 object categories and more challenging images.

## Contribute New Datasets

Contributing a new dataset involves several steps to ensure that it aligns well with the existing infrastructure. Below are the necessary steps:

### Steps to Contribute a New Dataset

1. **Collect Images**: Gather the images that belong to the dataset. These could be collected from various sources, such as public databases or your own collection.

2. **Annotate Images**: Annotate these images with bounding boxes, segments, or keypoints, depending on the task.

3. **Export Annotations**: Convert these annotations into the YOLO *.txt file format which Ultralytics supports.

4. **Organize Dataset**: Arrange your dataset into the correct folder structure. You should have `train/` and `val/` top-level directories, and within each, an `images/` and `labels/` sub-directory.

    ```
    dataset/
    ├── train/
    │   ├── images/
    │   └── labels/
    └── val/
        ├── images/
        └── labels/
    ```

5. **Create a `data.yaml` File**: In your dataset's root directory, create a `data.yaml` file that describes the dataset, classes, and other necessary information.

6. **Optimize Images (Optional)**: If you want to reduce the size of the dataset for more efficient processing, you can optimize the images using the code below. This is not required, but recommended for smaller dataset sizes and faster download speeds.

7. **Zip Dataset**: Compress the entire dataset folder into a zip file.

8. **Document and PR**: Create a documentation page describing your dataset and how it fits into the existing framework. After that, submit a Pull Request (PR). Refer to [Ultralytics Contribution Guidelines](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/contributing) for more details on how to submit a PR.

### Example Code to Optimize and Zip a Dataset

!!! example "Optimize and Zip a Dataset"

    === "Python"

    ```python
    from pathlib import Path

    from ultralytics.data.utils import compress_one_image
    from ultralytics.utils.downloads import zip_directory

    # Define dataset directory
    path = Path("path/to/dataset")

    # Optimize images in dataset (optional)
    for f in path.rglob("*.jpg"):
        compress_one_image(f)

    # Zip dataset into 'path/to/dataset.zip'
    zip_directory(path)
    ```

By following these steps, you can contribute a new dataset that integrates well with Ultralytics' existing structure.

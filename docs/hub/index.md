👋 Hello from the [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) Team! We've been working hard these last few months to
launch [Ultralytics HUB](https://bit.ly/ultralytics_hub), a new web tool for training and deploying all your YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 🚀
models from one spot!

## Introduction

HUB is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a drag-and-drop interface that allows users to
easily upload their data and train new models quickly. It offers a range of pre-trained models and
templates to choose from, making it easy for users to get started with training their own models. Once a model is
trained, it can be easily deployed and used for real-time object detection, instance segmentation and classification tasks.

We hope that the resources here will help you get the most out of HUB. Please browse the HUB <a href="https://docs.ultralytics.com/hub">Docs</a> for details, raise an issue on <a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/hub/issues/new/choose">GitHub</a> for support, and join our <a href="https://discord.gg/2wNGbc6g9X">Discord</a> community for questions and discussions!

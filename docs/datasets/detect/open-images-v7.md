## Dataset YAML

Typically, datasets come with a YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) file that delineates the dataset's configuration. For the case of Open Images V7, a hypothetical `OpenImagesV7.yaml` might exist. For accurate paths and configurations, one should refer to the dataset's official repository or documentation.

!!! example "OpenImagesV7.yaml"

    ```yaml
    --8<-- "ultralytics/cfg/datasets/open-images-v7.yaml"
    ```

## Usage

To train a YOLOv8n model on the Open Images V7 dataset for 100 epochs with an image size of 640, you can use the following code snippets. For a comprehensive list of available arguments, refer to the model [Training](../../modes/train.md) page.

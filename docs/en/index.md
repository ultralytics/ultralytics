## YOLO: A Brief History

[YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) (You Only Look Once), a popular [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) and [image segmentation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/image-segmentation) model, was developed by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi at the University of Washington. Launched in 2015, YOLO quickly gained popularity for its high speed and accuracy.

- [YOLOv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242), released in 2016, improved the original model by incorporating batch normalization, anchor boxes, and dimension clusters.
- [YOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf), launched in 2018, further enhanced the model's performance using a more efficient backbone network, multiple anchors and spatial pyramid pooling.
- [YOLOv4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934) was released in 2020, introducing innovations like Mosaic [data augmentation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/data-augmentation), a new anchor-free detection head, and a new [loss function](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/loss-function).
- [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) further improved the model's performance and added new features such as hyperparameter optimization, integrated experiment tracking and automatic export to popular export formats.
- [YOLOv6](https://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6) was open-sourced by [Meituan](https://www.meituan.com/) in 2022 and is in use in many of the company's autonomous delivery robots.
- [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) added additional tasks such as pose estimation on the COCO keypoints dataset.
- [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) released in 2023 by Ultralytics. YOLOv8 introduced new features and improvements for enhanced performance, flexibility, and efficiency, supporting a full range of vision AI tasks,
- [YOLOv9](models/yolov9.md) introduces innovative methods like Programmable Gradient Information (PGI) and the Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN).
- [YOLOv10](models/yolov10.md) is created by researchers from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) using the [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/). This version provides real-time [object detection](tasks/detect.md) advancements by introducing an End-to-End head that eliminates Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) requirements.
- **[YOLO11](models/yolo11.md) 🚀 NEW**: Ultralytics' latest YOLO models delivering state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple tasks, including [detection](tasks/detect.md), [segmentation](tasks/segment.md), [pose estimation](tasks/pose.md), [tracking](modes/track.md), and [classification](tasks/classify.md), leverage capabilities across diverse AI applications and domains.

Its state-of-the-art architecture ensures superior speed and accuracy, making it suitable for diverse applications, including edge devices and cloud APIs.

### How can I get started with YOLO installation and setup?

Getting started with YOLO is quick and straightforward. You can install the Ultralytics package using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/) and get up and running in minutes. Here's a basic installation command:

!!! example "Installation using pip"

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        pip install ultralytics
        ```

For a comprehensive step-by-step guide, visit our [quickstart guide](quickstart.md). This resource will help you with installation instructions, initial setup, and running your first model.

### How can I train a custom YOLO model on my dataset?

Training a custom YOLO model on your dataset involves a few detailed steps:

1. Prepare your annotated dataset.
2. Configure the training parameters in a YAML file.
3. Use the `yolo TASK train` command to start training. (Each `TASK` has its own argument)

Here's example code for the Object Detection Task:

!!! example "Train Example for Object Detection Task"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pre-trained YOLO model (you can choose n, s, m, l, or x versions)
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Start training on your custom dataset
        model.train(data="path/to/dataset.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Train a YOLO model from the command line
        yolo detect train data=path/to/dataset.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=640
        ```

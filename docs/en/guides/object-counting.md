## FAQ

### How do I count objects in a video using Ultralytics YOLO11?

To count objects in a video using Ultralytics YOLO11, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries (`cv2`, `ultralytics`).
2. Define the counting region (e.g., a polygon, line, etc.).
3. Set up the video capture and initialize the object counter.
4. Process each frame to track objects and count them within the defined region.

Here's a simple example for counting in a region:

```python
import cv2

from ultralytics import solutions


def count_objects_in_region(video_path, output_video_path, model_path):
    """Count objects in a specific region within a video."""
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    assert cap.isOpened(), "Error reading video file"
    w, h, fps = (int(cap.get(x)) for x in (cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))
    video_writer = cv2.VideoWriter(output_video_path, cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"mp4v"), fps, (w, h))

    region_points = [(20, 400), (1080, 404), (1080, 360), (20, 360)]
    counter = solutions.ObjectCounter(show=True, region=region_points, model=model_path)

    while cap.isOpened():
        success, im0 = cap.read()
        if not success:
            print("Video frame is empty or video processing has been successfully completed.")
            break
        im0 = counter.count(im0)
        video_writer.write(im0)

    cap.release()
    video_writer.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()


count_objects_in_region("path/to/video.mp4", "output_video.avi", "yolo11n.pt")
```

### How can I count specific classes of objects using Ultralytics YOLO11?

To count specific classes of objects using Ultralytics YOLO11, you need to specify the classes you are interested in during the tracking phase. Below is a Python example:

```python
import cv2

from ultralytics import solutions


def count_specific_classes(video_path, output_video_path, model_path, classes_to_count):
    """Count specific classes of objects in a video."""
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    assert cap.isOpened(), "Error reading video file"
    w, h, fps = (int(cap.get(x)) for x in (cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))
    video_writer = cv2.VideoWriter(output_video_path, cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"mp4v"), fps, (w, h))

    line_points = [(20, 400), (1080, 400)]
    counter = solutions.ObjectCounter(show=True, region=line_points, model=model_path, classes=classes_to_count)

    while cap.isOpened():
        success, im0 = cap.read()
        if not success:
            print("Video frame is empty or video processing has been successfully completed.")
            break
        im0 = counter.count(im0)
        video_writer.write(im0)

    cap.release()
    video_writer.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()


count_specific_classes("path/to/video.mp4", "output_specific_classes.avi", "yolo11n.pt", [0, 2])
```

In this example, `classes_to_count=[0, 2]`, which means it counts objects of class `0` and `2` (e.g., person and car).

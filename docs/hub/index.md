ðŸ‘‹ Hello from the [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) Team! We've been working hard these last few months to launch [Ultralytics HUB](https://bit.ly/ultralytics_hub), a new web tool for training and deploying all your YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 ðŸš€ models from one spot!

## Introduction

HUB is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a drag-and-drop interface that allows users to easily upload their data and train new models quickly. It offers a range of pre-trained models and templates to choose from, making it easy for users to get started with training their own models. Once a model is trained, it can be easily deployed and used for real-time object detection, instance segmentation and classification tasks.

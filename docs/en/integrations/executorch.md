- **Ahead-of-Time Compilation**: Models are compiled ahead of time, reducing startup latency and memory footprint
- **Flexible Delegation**: Support for hardware acceleration through various backends (CPU, GPU, NPU)

## Key Features of ExecuTorch Models

ExecuTorch provides several powerful features for deploying YOLO11 models on edge devices:

- **Portable Model Format**: ExecuTorch uses the `.pte` (PyTorch ExecuTorch) format, which is optimized for size and loading speed on resource-constrained devices.

- **XNNPACK Backend**: Default integration with XNNPACK provides highly optimized inference on mobile CPUs, delivering excellent performance without requiring specialized hardware.

- **Quantization Support**: Built-in support for quantization techniques to reduce model size and improve inference speed while maintaining accuracy.

- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized memory management reduces runtime memory footprint, making it suitable for devices with limited RAM.

- **Model Metadata**: Exported models include metadata (image size, class names, etc.) in a separate YAML file for easy integration.

## Deployment Options with ExecuTorch

ExecuTorch models can be deployed across various edge and mobile platforms:

- **Mobile Applications**: Deploy on iOS and Android applications with native performance, enabling real-time object detection in mobile apps.

- **Embedded Systems**: Run on embedded Linux devices like Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, and other ARM-based systems with optimized performance.

- **Edge AI Devices**: Deploy on specialized edge AI hardware with custom delegates for accelerated inference.

- **IoT Devices**: Integrate into IoT devices for on-device inference without cloud connectivity requirements.

## Export to ExecuTorch: Converting Your YOLO11 Model

Converting YOLO11 models to ExecuTorch format enables efficient deployment on mobile and edge devices.

### Requirements

ExecuTorch export requires Python 3.10 or higher and specific dependencies:

!!! tip "Installation"

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Install Ultralytics package
        pip install ultralytics

        # Install ExecuTorch (includes dependencies)
        pip install executorch
        ```

For detailed installation instructions, check our [Ultralytics Installation guide](../quickstart.md). If you encounter any issues, consult our [Common Issues guide](../guides/yolo-common-issues.md).

### Usage

Exporting YOLO11 models to ExecuTorch is straightforward:

!!! example "Usage"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load the YOLO11 model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Export the model to ExecuTorch format
        model.export(format="executorch")  # creates 'yolo11n_executorch_model' directory

        # The exported directory contains:
        # - yolo11n.pte (model file)
        # - metadata.yaml (model metadata)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Export a YOLO11n PyTorch model to ExecuTorch format
        yolo export model=yolo11n.pt format=executorch # creates 'yolo11n_executorch_model' directory
        ```

### Export Arguments

When exporting to ExecuTorch format, you can specify the following arguments:

| Argument | Type            | Default | Description                                |
| -------- | --------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `imgsz`  | `int` or `list` | `640`   | Image size for model input (height, width) |
| `device` | `str`           | `'cpu'` | Device to use for export (`'cpu'`)         |

!!! example "Export with Custom Arguments"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")
        # Export with custom image size
        model.export(format="executorch", imgsz=320)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo export model=yolo11n.pt format=executorch imgsz=320
        ```

### Output Structure

The ExecuTorch export creates a directory containing the model and metadata:

```text
yolo11n_executorch_model/
├── yolo11n.pte              # ExecuTorch model file
└── metadata.yaml            # Model metadata (classes, image size, etc.)
```

## Using Exported ExecuTorch Models

After exporting your model, you'll need to integrate it into your target application using the ExecuTorch runtime.

### Mobile Integration

For mobile applications (iOS/Android), you'll need to:

1. **Add ExecuTorch Runtime**: Include the ExecuTorch runtime library in your mobile project
2. **Load Model**: Load the `.pte` file in your application
3. **Run Inference**: Process images and get predictions

Example iOS integration (Objective-C/C++):

```objc
// iOS uses C++ APIs for model loading and inference
// See https://pytorch.org/executorch/stable/using-executorch-ios.html for complete examples

#include <executorch/extension/module/module.h>

using namespace ::executorch::extension;

// Load the model
Module module("/path/to/yolo11n.pte");

// Create input tensor
float input[1 * 3 * 640 * 640];
auto tensor = from_blob(input, {1, 3, 640, 640});

// Run inference
const auto result = module.forward(tensor);
```

Example Android integration (Kotlin):

```kotlin
import org.pytorch.executorch.EValue
import org.pytorch.executorch.Module
import org.pytorch.executorch.Tensor

// Load the model
val module = Module.load("/path/to/yolo11n.pte")

// Prepare input tensor
val inputTensor = Tensor.fromBlob(floatData, longArrayOf(1, 3, 640, 640))
val inputEValue = EValue.from(inputTensor)

// Run inference
val outputs = module.forward(inputEValue)
val scores = outputs[0].toTensor().dataAsFloatArray
```

### Embedded Linux

For embedded Linux systems, use the ExecuTorch C++ API:

```cpp
#include <executorch/extension/module/module.h>

// Load model
auto module = torch::executor::Module("yolo11n.pte");

// Prepare input
std::vector<float> input_data = preprocessImage(image);
auto input_tensor = torch::executor::Tensor(input_data, {1, 3, 640, 640});

// Run inference
auto outputs = module.forward({input_tensor});
```

## Performance Optimization

### Model Size Optimization

To reduce model size for deployment:

- **Use Smaller Models**: Start with YOLO11n (nano) for the smallest footprint
- **Lower Input Resolution**: Use smaller image sizes (e.g., `imgsz=320` or `imgsz=416`)
- **Quantization**: Apply quantization techniques (supported in future ExecuTorch versions)

### Inference Speed Optimization

For faster inference:

- **XNNPACK Backend**: The default XNNPACK backend provides optimized CPU inference
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Use platform-specific delegates (e.g., CoreML for iOS)
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple images when possible

## Comparing ExecuTorch to Other Formats

When choosing an export format, consider the following comparison:

| Format         | Model Size | CPU Speed | Mobile Support | Hardware Accel | Ease of Use |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| PyTorch        | Large      | Baseline  | ❌             | ✅             | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  |
| TorchScript    | Large      | Good      | ✅             | Limited        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    |
| ONNX           | Medium     | Fast      | ✅             | ✅             | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    |
| CoreML         | Small      | Fast      | iOS Only       | ✅             | ⭐⭐⭐      |
| TFLite         | Small      | Fast      | ✅             | ✅             | ⭐⭐⭐      |
| **ExecuTorch** | **Small**  | **Fast**  | ✅             | ✅             | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    |

ExecuTorch offers an excellent balance of model size, performance, and ease of use, especially for applications already using PyTorch.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: `Python version error`

**Solution**: ExecuTorch requires Python 3.10 or higher. Upgrade your Python installation:

    ```bash
    # Using conda
    conda create -n executorch python=3.10
    conda activate executorch
    ```

**Issue**: `Export fails during first run`

**Solution**: ExecuTorch may need to download and compile components on first use. Ensure you have:

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade executorch
    ```

**Issue**: `Import errors for ExecuTorch modules`

**Solution**: Ensure ExecuTorch is properly installed:

    ```bash
    pip install executorch --force-reinstall
    ```

Choose ExecuTorch if you're already using PyTorch and want a native deployment path. Choose TFLite for maximum compatibility and mature tooling.

### Can I use ExecuTorch models with GPU acceleration?

Yes! ExecuTorch supports hardware acceleration through various backends:

- **Mobile GPU**: Via Vulkan, Metal, or OpenCL delegates
- **NPU/DSP**: Via platform-specific delegates

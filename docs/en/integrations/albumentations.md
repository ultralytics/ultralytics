Created with [performance](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/measuring-ai-performance-to-weigh-the-impact-of-your-innovations) and flexibility in mind, it supports many diverse augmentation techniques, ranging from simple transformations like rotations and flips to more complex adjustments like brightness and contrast changes. Albumentations helps developers generate rich, varied datasets for tasks like [image classification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BO0Il_YYAg), [object detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ku7npMrW40&t=1s), and [segmentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4Zd-IeMlSY).

You can use Albumentations to easily apply augmentations to images, [segmentation masks](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/image-segmentation), [bounding boxes](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/bounding-box), and [key points](../datasets/pose/index.md), and make sure that all elements of your dataset are transformed together. It works seamlessly with popular deep learning frameworks like [PyTorch](../integrations/torchscript.md) and [TensorFlow](../integrations/tensorboard.md), making it accessible for a wide range of projects.

Also, Albumentations is a great option for augmentation whether you're handling small datasets or large-scale [computer vision tasks](../tasks/index.md). It ensures fast and efficient processing, cutting down the time spent on data preparation. At the same time, it helps improve [model performance](../guides/yolo-performance-metrics.md), making your models more effective in real-world applications.

## Key Features of Albumentations

Albumentations offers many useful features that simplify complex image augmentations for a wide range of [computer vision applications](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/exploring-how-the-applications-of-computer-vision-work). Here are some of the key features:

- **Wide Range of Transformations**: Albumentations offers over [70 different transformations](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations?tab=readme-ov-file#list-of-augmentations), including geometric changes (e.g., rotation, flipping), color adjustments (e.g., brightness, contrast), and noise addition (e.g., Gaussian noise). Having multiple options enables the creation of highly diverse and robust training datasets.

</p>

- **High Performance Optimization**: Built on OpenCV and NumPy, Albumentations uses advanced optimization techniques like SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data), which processes multiple data points simultaneously to speed up processing. It handles large datasets quickly, making it one of the fastest options available for image augmentation.

- **Three Levels of Augmentation**: Albumentations supports three levels of augmentation: pixel-level transformations, spatial-level transformations, and mixing-level transformation. Pixel-level transformations only affect the input images without altering masks, bounding boxes, or key points. Meanwhile, both the image and its elements, like masks and bounding boxes, are transformed using spatial-level transformations. Furthermore, mixing-level transformations are a unique way to augment data as it combines multiple images into one.

![Overview of the Different Levels of Augmentations](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/levels-of-augmentation.avif)

- **[Benchmarking Results](https://albumentations.ai/docs/benchmarking_results/)**: When it comes to benchmarking, Albumentations consistently outperforms other libraries, especially with large datasets.

## Why Should You Use Albumentations for Your Vision AI Projects?

With respect to image augmentation, Albumentations stands out as a reliable tool for computer vision tasks. Here are a few key reasons why you should consider using it for your Vision AI projects:

- **Easy-to-Use API**: Albumentations provides a single, straightforward API for applying a wide range of augmentations to images, masks, bounding boxes, and keypoints. It's designed to adapt easily to different datasets, making [data preparation](../guides/data-collection-and-annotation.md) simpler and more efficient.

- **Rigorous Bug Testing**: Bugs in the augmentation pipeline can silently corrupt input data, often going unnoticed but ultimately degrading model performance. Albumentations addresses this with a thorough test suite that helps catch bugs early in development.

- **Extensibility**: Albumentations can be used to easily add new augmentations and use them in computer vision pipelines through a single interface along with built-in transformations.

## How to Use Albumentations to Augment Data for YOLO11 Training

Now that we've covered what Albumentations is and what it can do, let's look at how to use it to augment your data for YOLO11 model training. It's easy to set up because it integrates directly into [Ultralytics' training mode](../modes/train.md) and applies automatically if you have the Albumentations package installed.

### Installation

To use Albumentations with YOLOv11, start by making sure you have the necessary packages installed. If Albumentations isn't installed, the augmentations won't be applied during training. Once set up, you'll be ready to create an augmented dataset for training, with Albumentations integrated to enhance your model automatically.

!!! tip "Installation"

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Install the required packages
        pip install albumentations ultralytics
        ```

For detailed instructions and best practices related to the installation process, check our [Ultralytics Installation guide](../quickstart.md). While installing the required packages for YOLO11, if you encounter any difficulties, consult our [Common Issues guide](../guides/yolo-common-issues.md) for solutions and tips.

### Usage

After installing the necessary packages, you're ready to start using Albumentations with YOLO11. When you train YOLOv11, a set of augmentations is automatically applied through its integration with Albumentations, making it easy to enhance your model's performance.

!!! example "Usage"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pre-trained model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Train the model
        results = model.train(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)
        ```

Next, let's take look a closer look at the specific augmentations that are applied during training.

### Blur

The Blur transformation in Albumentations applies a simple blur effect to the image by averaging pixel values within a small square area, or kernel. This is done using OpenCV's `cv2.blur` function, which helps reduce noise in the image, though it also slightly reduces image details.

Here are the parameters and values used in this integration:

- **blur_limit**: This controls the size range of the blur effect. The default range is (3, 7), meaning the kernel size for the blur can vary between 3 and 7 pixels, with only odd numbers allowed to keep the blur centered.

- **p**: The probability of applying the blur. In the integration, p=0.01, so there's a 1% chance that this blur will be applied to each image. The low probability allows for occasional blur effects, introducing a bit of variation to help the model generalize without over-blurring the images.

### Median Blur

The MedianBlur transformation in Albumentations applies a median blur effect to the image, which is particularly useful for reducing noise while preserving edges. Unlike typical blurring methods, MedianBlur uses a median filter, which is especially effective at removing salt-and-pepper noise while maintaining sharpness around the edges.

Here are the parameters and values used in this integration:

- **blur_limit**: This parameter controls the maximum size of the blurring kernel. In this integration, it defaults to a range of (3, 7), meaning the kernel size for the blur is randomly chosen between 3 and 7 pixels, with only odd values allowed to ensure proper alignment.

- **p**: Sets the probability of applying the median blur. Here, p=0.01, so the transformation has a 1% chance of being applied to each image. This low probability ensures that the median blur is used sparingly, helping the model generalize by occasionally seeing images with reduced noise and preserved edges.

The image below shows an example of this augmentation applied to an image.

<img width="764" alt="An Example of the MedianBlur Augmentation" src="https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/albumentations-median-blur.avif">

### Grayscale

The ToGray transformation in Albumentations converts an image to grayscale, reducing it to a single-channel format and optionally replicating this channel to match a specified number of output channels. Different methods can be used to adjust how grayscale brightness is calculated, ranging from simple averaging to more advanced techniques for realistic perception of contrast and brightness.

Here are the parameters and values used in this integration:

- **num_output_channels**: Sets the number of channels in the output image. If this value is more than 1, the single grayscale channel will be replicated to create a multi-channel grayscale image. By default, it's set to 3, giving a grayscale image with three identical channels.

- **method**: Defines the grayscale conversion method. The default method, "weighted_average", applies a formula (0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B) that closely aligns with human perception, providing a natural-looking grayscale effect. Other options, like "from_lab", "desaturation", "average", "max", and "pca", offer alternative ways to create grayscale images based on various needs for speed, brightness emphasis, or detail preservation.

- **p**: Controls how often the grayscale transformation is applied. With p=0.01, there is a 1% chance of converting each image to grayscale, making it possible for a mix of color and grayscale images to help the model generalize better.

The image below shows an example of this grayscale transformation applied.

<img width="759" alt="An Example of the ToGray Augmentation" src="https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/albumentations-grayscale.avif">

### Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)

The CLAHE transformation in Albumentations applies Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), a technique that enhances image contrast by equalizing the histogram in localized regions (tiles) instead of across the whole image. CLAHE produces a balanced enhancement effect, avoiding the overly amplified contrast that can result from standard histogram equalization, especially in areas with initially low contrast.

Here are the parameters and values used in this integration:

- **clip_limit**: Controls the contrast enhancement range. Set to a default range of (1, 4), it determines the maximum contrast allowed in each tile. Higher values are used for more contrast but may also introduce noise.

- **tile_grid_size**: Defines the size of the grid of tiles, typically as (rows, columns). The default value is (8, 8), meaning the image is divided into an 8x8 grid. Smaller tile sizes provide more localized adjustments, while larger ones create effects closer to global equalization.

- **p**: The probability of applying CLAHE. Here, p=0.01 introduces the enhancement effect only 1% of the time, ensuring that contrast adjustments are applied sparingly for occasional variation in training images.

The image below shows an example of the CLAHE transformation applied.

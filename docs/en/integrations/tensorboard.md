!!! example "Usage"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pre-trained model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Train the model
        results = model.train(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)

## Understanding Your TensorBoard for YOLO11 Training

Now, let's focus on understanding the various features and components of TensorBoard in the context of YOLO11 training. The three key sections of the TensorBoard are Time Series, Scalars, and Graphs.

### Time Series

The Time Series feature in the TensorBoard offers a dynamic and detailed perspective of various training metrics over time for YOLO11 models. It focuses on the progression and trends of metrics across training epochs. Here's an example of what you can expect to see.

![image](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/time-series-tensorboard-yolov8.avif)

#### Key Features of Time Series in TensorBoard

- **Filter Tags and Pinned Cards**: This functionality allows users to filter specific metrics and pin cards for quick comparison and access. It's particularly useful for focusing on specific aspects of the training process.

- **Detailed Metric Cards**: Time Series divides metrics into different categories like [learning rate](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/learning-rate) (lr), training (train), and validation (val) metrics, each represented by individual cards.

- **Graphical Display**: Each card in the Time Series section shows a detailed graph of a specific metric over the course of training. This visual representation aids in identifying trends, patterns, or anomalies in the training process.

- **In-Depth Analysis**: Time Series provides an in-depth analysis of each metric. For instance, different learning rate segments are shown, offering insights into how adjustments in learning rate impact the model's learning curve.

#### Importance of Time Series in YOLO11 Training

The Time Series section is essential for a thorough analysis of the YOLO11 model's training progress. It lets you track the metrics in real time to promptly identify and solve issues. It also offers a detailed view of each metric's progression, which is crucial for fine-tuning the model and enhancing its performance.

### Scalars

Scalars in the TensorBoard are crucial for plotting and analyzing simple metrics like loss and accuracy during the training of YOLO11 models. They offer a clear and concise view of how these metrics evolve with each training [epoch](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/epoch), providing insights into the model's learning effectiveness and stability. Here's an example of what you can expect to see.

![image](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/scalars-metrics-tensorboard.avif)

#### Key Features of Scalars in TensorBoard

- **Learning Rate (lr) Tags**: These tags show the variations in the learning rate across different segments (e.g., `pg0`, `pg1`, `pg2`). This helps us understand the impact of learning rate adjustments on the training process.

- **Metrics Tags**: Scalars include performance indicators such as:

    - `mAP50 (B)`: Mean Average [Precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/precision) at 50% [Intersection over Union](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/intersection-over-union-iou) (IoU), crucial for assessing object detection accuracy.

    - `mAP50-95 (B)`: [Mean Average Precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/mean-average-precision-map) calculated over a range of IoU thresholds, offering a more comprehensive evaluation of accuracy.

    - `Precision (B)`: Indicates the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations, key to understanding prediction [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy).

    - `Recall (B)`: Important for models where missing a detection is significant, this metric measures the ability to detect all relevant instances.

    - To learn more about the different metrics, read our guide on [performance metrics](../guides/yolo-performance-metrics.md).

- **Training and Validation Tags (`train`, `val`)**: These tags display metrics specifically for the training and validation datasets, allowing for a comparative analysis of model performance across different data sets.

#### Importance of Monitoring Scalars

Observing scalar metrics is crucial for fine-tuning the YOLO11 model. Variations in these metrics, such as spikes or irregular patterns in loss graphs, can highlight potential issues such as [overfitting](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/overfitting), [underfitting](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/underfitting), or inappropriate learning rate settings. By closely monitoring these scalars, you can make informed decisions to optimize the training process, ensuring that the model learns effectively and achieves the desired performance.

### Difference Between Scalars and Time Series

While both Scalars and Time Series in TensorBoard are used for tracking metrics, they serve slightly different purposes. Scalars focus on plotting simple metrics such as loss and accuracy as scalar values. They provide a high-level overview of how these metrics change with each training epoch. Meanwhile, the time-series section of the TensorBoard offers a more detailed timeline view of various metrics. It is particularly useful for monitoring the progression and trends of metrics over time, providing a deeper dive into the specifics of the training process.

### Graphs

The Graphs section of the TensorBoard visualizes the computational graph of the YOLO11 model, showing how operations and data flow within the model. It's a powerful tool for understanding the model's structure, ensuring that all layers are connected correctly, and for identifying any potential bottlenecks in data flow. Here's an example of what you can expect to see.

![image](https://github.com/ultralytics/docs/releases/download/0/tensorboard-yolov8-computational-graph.avif)

Graphs are particularly useful for debugging the model, especially in complex architectures typical in [deep learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/deep-learning-dl) models like YOLO11. They help in verifying layer connections and the overall design of the model.

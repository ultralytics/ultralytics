### PR recommendations

To allow your work to be integrated as seamlessly as possible, we advise you to:

- ✅ Verify your PR is **up-to-date** with `ultralytics/ultralytics` `main` branch. If your PR is behind you can update
  your code by clicking the 'Update branch' button or by running `git pull` and `git merge main` locally.

- ✅ Verify all YOLOv8 Continuous Integration (CI) **checks are passing**.

- ✅ Reduce changes to the absolute **minimum** required for your bug fix or feature addition. _"It is not daily increase
  but daily decrease, hack away the unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is."_ — Bruce Lee

### Docstrings

Not all functions or classes require docstrings but when they do, we
follow [google-style docstrings format](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).
Here is an example:

```python
"""
What the function does. Performs NMS on given detection predictions.

Args:
    arg1: The description of the 1st argument
    arg2: The description of the 2nd argument

Returns:
    What the function returns. Empty if nothing is returned.

Raises:
    Exception Class: When and why this exception can be raised by the function.
"""
```

## Submitting a Bug Report 🐛

If you spot a problem with YOLOv8 please submit a Bug Report!

For us to start investigating a possible problem we need to be able to reproduce it ourselves first. We've created a few
short guidelines below to help users provide what we need in order to get started.

When asking a question, people will be better able to provide help if you provide **code** that they can easily
understand and use to **reproduce** the problem. This is referred to by community members as creating
a [minimum reproducible example](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/minimum_reproducible_example/). Your code that reproduces
the problem should be:

- ✅ **Minimal** – Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem
- ✅ **Complete** – Provide **all** parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem in the question itself
- ✅ **Reproducible** – Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem

In addition to the above requirements, for [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) to provide assistance your code
should be:

- ✅ **Current** – Verify that your code is up-to-date with current
  GitHub [main](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/tree/main) branch, and if necessary `git pull` or `git clone`
  a new copy to ensure your problem has not already been resolved by previous commits.
- ✅ **Unmodified** – Your problem must be reproducible without any modifications to the codebase in this
  repository. [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) does not provide support for custom code ⚠️.

If you believe your problem meets all of the above criteria, please close this issue and raise a new one using the 🐛
**Bug Report** [template](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/issues/new/choose) and providing
a [minimum reproducible example](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/minimum_reproducible_example/) to help us better
understand and diagnose your problem.
